</p>

<h3><a name="A" id="A"></a>Abbeville, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between the English Barons and Louis IX of France, signed in
1259, shortly after the establishment in England of the Council of
Fifteen. By its provisions England retained Bordeaux, Bayonne, and
Gascony, and surrendered all claim to Normandy, Anjou, Poitou, and
Maine. The French king agreed to supply a sum of money sufficient to
maintain for two years five hundred knights, to be employed for the
benefit of England or of the Church.</p>

<h3>Abecedarians.</h3>

<p>A branch of the Anabaptists, founded in Germany in the sixteenth century
by Stork, a disciple of Luther. They held that all human knowledge was
valueless, and therefore declined to learn even the alphabet.</p>

<h3>Abencerrages.</h3>

<p>A noble Moorish family of Granada, in the fifteenth century. They were
accused by a rival family, the Zegris, of plotting against Abdallah,
King of Granada, and were lured into the Alhambra, where they were
barbarously massacred. Thirty-six members of the family perished.</p>

<h3>Abhorrers.</h3>

<p>Another name for the Tories in the reign of Charles II. They were so
called from their use of the word in their addresses to the king,
protesting against the petitions in favour of summoning a Parliament in
1679.</p>

<h3>Abingdon Law.</h3>

<p>Execution first and trial afterwards. The phrase is derived from the
methods adopted by Major-General Brown, of the Commonwealth Army, at
Abingdon, during the Civil War. It was his habit, it is said, to deal in
this fashion with Malignants who fell into his hands.</p>

<h3>Abjuration, Act of (England).</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1702, imposing upon all who took office under the
State, an oath abjuring the House of Stuart, and binding them to support
each successor to the throne named in the Act of Settlement.</p>

<h3>Abjuration, Act of (Netherlands).</h3>

<p>The declaration of independence made at The Hague in 1581 by the
deputies of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, deposing Philip II.
It did not, however, substitute any other form of government.</p>

<h3>Abo, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Russia and Sweden, signed in 1743, after the surrender
of the Swedish army at Helsingfors. Russia acquired Finland, as far as
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> river Kiümer, and secured the election of Adolphus Frederick of
Holstein as Crown Prince of Sweden, in the place of the Prince Royal of
Denmark.</p>

<h3>Abolitionists.</h3>

<p>The extreme anti-slavery party in the United States, in 1860. They
demanded the total abolition of slavery, and would agree to no
compromise with the South, even at the cost of civil war.</p>

<h3>Absentee Tax.</h3>

<p>A tax imposed upon absentee landlords in Ireland, in the reign of
Richard II. An attempt was made to reimpose it in 1773, but
unsuccessfully, mainly owing to the opposition of Edmund Burke.</p>

<h3>Academic Legion.</h3>

<p>A body of armed students who took an active part in the revolutionary
disturbances in Vienna in 1848.</p>

<h3>Acadia.</h3>

<p>The original name of Nova Scotia.</p>

<h3>Acte Additionel.</h3>

<p>A proclamation by Napoleon, on his return from Elba in 1815, in which he
accepted, with some slight modifications, the <i>Charte</i> of Louis XVIII.</p>

<h3>Adam Kok, Treaty with.</h3>

<p>A treaty made with Adam Kok, a Griqua chief, by Sir Peregrine Maitland
in 1845. One of its provisions, which later caused considerable trouble
in the Orange River Sovereignty, prevented the alienation of land by the
Griquas to Europeans over a considerable portion of Kok’s territory. The
treaty was denounced by Great Britain in 1856 after the Convention of
Bloemfontein.</p>

<h3>Addled Parliament.</h3>

<p>A Parliament summoned by James I, in 1615. An attempt by certain of its
members, who were dubbed the Undertakers, to control it in the interests
of the Court, failed signally, and the king promptly dissolved it.</p>

<h3>Adendorff Trek.</h3>

<p>A threatened trek of a large number of Transvaal Boers, under a leader
named Adendorff, into Mashonaland, in 1891. Sir Henry Loch raised a
protest, on the ground that the trek would be an infringement of the
Swaziland Convention of 1890, and an act of hostility towards Great
Britain, whereupon President Kruger issued a proclamation forbidding all
Transvaal burghers to take part in the movement.</p>

<h3>Adis Ababa, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed May 15, 1902, between Great Britain and Ethiopia
(Abyssinia). It provides for the rectification and delimitation of the
frontier between Abyssinia and the Soudan. The Negus undertakes not to
sanction any damming of the Sobat or the Blue Nile without the consent
of Great Britain, grants a lease of a tract of country on the Baro
river, for the formation of a commercial <i>entrepôt</i>, and gives Great
Britain the right to connect Uganda and the Soudan by a railway running
through Abyssinia. A further treaty, to which Italy is also a party,
provides for the rectification of the frontiers of Eritrea with
Abyssinia and the Soudan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span></p>

<h3>Adjutators.</h3>

<p>Delegates elected by each regiment of the Parliamentary Army in 1647, to
act with the officers in placing their demands and grievances before
Parliament prior to disbandment.</p>

<h3>Admonition.</h3>

<p>A document issued by Thomas Cartwright, the leader of the Puritans, in
1572, demanding the establishment of Presbyterianism, as being a divine
institution.</p>

<h3>Admonition, Cardinal Allen’s.</h3>

<p>A pamphlet addressed to the “Nobility and People of England,” bringing a
series of scandalous charges against Queen Elizabeth, issued by Cardinal
Allen in 1588.</p>

<h3>Adonis of Fifty.</h3>

<p>A nickname of George IV.</p>

<h3>Adrian, Bull of.</h3>

<p>A bull issued by Adrian IV, in 1156, granting the sovereignty of Ireland
to Henry II, in return for his undertaking to support the Papal
authority, and to pay Peter’s Pence.</p>

<h3>Adrianople, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Russia and Turkey, signed in 1829, following the
capture by Russia of the fortresses of Varna, Silistria, and Adrianople.
It gave Russia control over the mouths of the Danube, and the
appointment of protector of the privileges of Moldavia and Wallachia.</p>

<h3>Adriatic, Marriage of the.</h3>

<p>An ancient ceremony celebrated yearly at Venice on Ascension Day, and
typifying the greatness of Venice as a maritime power. The Doge was
conveyed in his state barge to the sea, and threw into the water a
consecrated ring. The ceremony was established in 1174 by Pope Alexander
III, in memory of the victory of the Venetians over the fleet of
Barbarossa.</p>

<h3>Adscriptus Glebæ.</h3>

<p>A person who was compelled to remain on his lord’s estate. The condition
of a villein or serf in feudal times.</p>

<h3>Adullamites.</h3>

<p>A small section of the Liberal party, headed by Mr. Lowe (Lord
Sherbrooke) who opposed Mr. Gladstone’s Reform Bill of 1866. The name
had its origin in a speech of John Bright, who likened the malcontents
to those who took refuge in the Cave of Adullam. The term “cave” is now
applied to any small knot of dissentients within the ranks of one of the
great political parties.</p>

<h3>Adventurers of 1642.</h3>

<p>The gentlemen and others who had advanced money to the Government during
the Irish Rebellion of 1641, to be repaid by grants of forfeited land.
In 1653 these claims were recognized by grants in various parts of
Leinster and Munster.</p>

<h3>Afrancesados.</h3>

<p>The partizans of Napoleon in Spain and the Spanish Colonies.</p>

<h3>Afrikander Bond.</h3>

<p>An organization formed in Cape Colony in 1881, with the avowed object of
securing for the Afrikanders a larger share of political power. Its
moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> Spirit was Mr. Hofmeyr, a member of the Cape Ministry. It has
taken a leading part in Cape politics, generally in opposition to
British rule, and during the Boer war of 1899-1902 gave strong evidence
of disloyalty.</p>

<h3>Agraviados.</h3>

<p>The Catalan insurgents, in 1825, called themselves the Agraviados, or
men with a grievance.</p>

<h3>Agrarian League.</h3>

<p>A league formed in Berlin in 1893, to advocate bimetalism and a return
to protection. In the latter portion of its programme, it has had
considerable success.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Alliance Bill.</h3>

<p>The name given to a bill passed by the Prussian Parliament in 1896, at
the instigation of the Agricultural Alliance. It prohibited time
bargains in corn, mining shares, etc., and provided for the regulation
of the Berlin Bourse, Corn Exchange, and other Exchanges, by a committee
under a Government official. To escape these vexatious restrictions, the
produce brokers deserted the Exchange and formed a Free Commercial
Union, meeting in another building to carry on their business.</p>

<h3>Aids.</h3>

<p>Taxes levied on their feudatories by the English kings, prior to Magna
Charta. By that instrument, however, it was provided that they were to
be granted only by the Great Council, except in three specified cases:
the delivery of the king from prison, the knighting of the king’s eldest
son, or the marriage of his eldest daughter.</p>

<h3>Aigun, Convention of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Russia and China, signed in 1858, by which Russia
obtained all the territory eastward of the Ussuri river to the Japan
Sea, and fixed her southern boundary at the frontier of Corea.</p>

<h3>Aix-la-Chapelle, Congress of.</h3>

<p>A congress held in 1818, and attended by plenipotentiaries from Great
Britain, Prussia, Austria and Russia, to arrange for the evacuation of
France by the army of occupation, and the readmission of France, as one
of the Great Powers, to the Councils of Europe.</p>

<h3>Aix-la-Chapelle, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between the Triple Alliance (England, Holland and Sweden) and
Louis XIV of France, signed in May, 1668. Spain, which acceded to the
Treaty, received Franche Comté from France, and surrendered certain
frontier towns, including Lille, Courtray, and Tournay. The Triple
Alliance were thus enabled to checkmate Louis’ designs in the Low
Countries.</p>

<h3>Aix-la-Chapelle, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed by England, France, Austria, Spain, and Holland, in
1748, putting an end to the War of the Austrian Succession.
Territorially, its provisions in the main amounted to a return to the
<i>status quo ante</i>, but it was provided that the Pretender should be
expelled from France, that Spain should renew the Asiento treaty with
England, and that Austria was to receive the acknowledgment by the
signatories of the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> of Lorraine, husband of Maria Theresa, as
Emperor, in return for the cession of Silesia to Prussia.</p>

<h3>Akerman, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Russia and Turkey, supplementary to the Treaty of
Bucharest, signed in 1826. It provided that the Hospodars of Moldavia
and Wallachia should rule independently, each with a council of Boyars,
and should not be deposed without the Czar’s consent; that Servia should
elect her own princes, and that Russia should occupy the East coast of
the Black Sea, and should have free access to all Turkish waters.</p>

<h3>Alabama.</h3>

<p>A privateer fitted out in England during the American Civil War, to prey
upon the commerce of the Northern States. After the war the United
States made an enormous claim for compensation, which was submitted to
arbitration, with the result that England was condemned to pay about
three and a half millions sterling.</p>

<h3>Alais, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between the Catholics and the Huguenots in France, signed in

finally deprived of their political rights.</p>

<h3>Alaric Cottin.</h3>

<p>A sobriquet of Frederick the Great of Prussia, given him by Voltaire. It
infers that he was a great soldier but a very poor poet.</p>

<h3>Alascans.</h3>

<p>The name given to the foreign Protestant refugees in England during the
reign of Edward VI. The name is derived from Laski, the superintendent
of foreign church communities.</p>

<h3>Alaska Purchase.</h3>

<p>By a treaty between the United States and Russia, in 1867, the latter
Power surrendered all her possessions on the continent of the United
States, together with the Probyloff Islands, in consideration of a
payment of 7,200,000 dols.</p>

<h3>Alaska Treaty.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Great Britain and the United States, signed in 1903, by
which it was agreed to submit the question of the boundary between
Alaska and Canada to a commission of six jurists, three to be nominated
by each side. This question had been pending since the cession of Alaska
to the United States by Russia in 1867, the doubt as to the true
frontier arising from the very indefinite terms of the Anglo-Russian
Convention of 1825.</p>

<h3>Albanian League.</h3>

<p>A league founded by the Porte in 1880, to oppose the aspirations of
Montenegro towards an increase of territory. In 1887 the league
presented to the Sultan a petition for autonomy, under an Albanian
governor, and receiving no answer, rose in rebellion. The outbreak,
however, was easily suppressed.</p>

<h3>Albany Regency.</h3>

<p>A coterie of Democrats who from 1820 to 1854 exercised a controlling
influence over the politics of New York State, and had consequently
considerable power in national politics. Their headquarters were at
Albany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<h3>Albigenses.</h3>

<p>A sect of dissenters from the Romish doctrine, settled in the South of
France, under the protection of Raymond, Count of Toulouse, their name
being derived from the town of Albi. Innocent III organised a crusade
against them in 1215, under the leadership of Simon de Montfort, and at
the siege of Béziers it is estimated that 15,000 Albigenses were put to
the sword. They nevertheless held out until 1229, when Raymond
capitulated, and the Inquisition was established in Toulouse. The sect,
though dispersed, was not destroyed, and its members carried the seeds
of Protestantism into Bohemia, Germany and England.</p>

<h3>Alcantara, Knights of.</h3>

<p>A Spanish order of religious chivalry, established in 1177, and directed
against Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>An official appointed annually the Court-Leet to test and examine the
ale sold in the borough, and to prosecute dishonest vendors.</p>

<h3>Alexander of Bulgaria, Abduction of.</h3>

<p>A conspiracy of the pro-Russian party in Bulgaria, in 1886. Prince
Alexander, whose policy was to free his country from Russian influence,
was kidnapped by some Bulgarian officers, and carried off in his yacht
to Russian territory. An attempt was then made to establish a
pro-Russian government under M. Zankoff, but the sympathies of the
Bulgarians were with the Prince, and M. Stambuloff set up a Council of
Regency, and demanded his return. The Prince came back, but with nerves
completely shattered by his experiences, or, as was alleged, by the
administration of certain drugs, and he shortly afterwards abdicated.
There seems little doubt that the Russian Foreign Office was privy to
the plot.</p>

passports for moving to and fro.</p>

<h3>Alien and Sedition Laws.</h3>

<p>A series of Acts of Congress passed in 1798, to deal with the situation
caused by the residence in the United States of a large number of
naturalized Frenchmen who sympathized with France in the difficulties
then pending between the two countries. They gave the President the
power to banish undesirable aliens. They were very unpopular, and were,
in fact, never enforced with any stringency, but are noticeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> as
having led to the first declaration of States Rights, Kentucky and
Virginia declaring them unconstitutional.</p>

<h3>Aliwal North, First Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty, signed in 1858 between the Orange Free State and Moshesh, the
Basuto chief, through the mediation of Sir George Grey. This treaty
rectified the frontier somewhat in favour of the Basutos, and made other
provisions tending to the maintenance of peace.</p>

<h3>Aliwal North, Second Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Great Britain and the Orange Free State, signed in
1869, settling the boundary between the two contracting parties in
Basutoland. After the annexation by Great Britain of the territories of
Moshesh, the Orange Free State claimed the boundary line fixed by the
treaty of Thaba Bosigo, while Great Britain claimed that in existence
before the war of 1865. A compromise was eventually arrived at, and the
frontier thus fixed is that at present existing between the Orange River
Colony and the Cape.</p>

<h3>All Red Cable.</h3>

<p>A cable route from England to Australia, touching only British soil,

relating to the American Colonies. It declared that all American vessels
were lawful prizes, and that all Americans captured in them, or
elsewhere, could be forced to take service against America.
Commissioners were appointed to receive the submission of the revolted
colonies, but no provisions were made for the redress of grievances.</p>

<h3>America, Discovery of.</h3>

<p>According to the Norse Sagas, the discovery of America should be placed
to the credit of the Vikings, who made five expeditions to the coast
between 985 and 1011, the first being that of Eric the Red, who settled
in Greenland in 986, and the most famous that of Thorfinn Karlsefne,
about 1007. The rediscovery by Columbus took place in 1492.</p>

<h3>American Customs Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1764, levying customs duties on goods imported into the
American Colonies. These duties were to be levied for the benefit of
England, and the proceeds thereof paid into the English Treasury. The
assertion of this right to tax the Colonies for the benefit of the
Mother Country may be considered the cause of the loss of the American
Colonies.</p>

<h3>American-Japanese Treaty.</h3>

<p>A treaty negotiated between the Shôgun and Commodore Perry on behalf of
the United States in 1854, by which Japan opened the ports of Yokohama,

of the Dutch, who however were strictly confined to their factory at
Deshima.</p>

the King’s right to employ aliens as governors of his castles. Also
known as the Mise of Amiens.</p>

<h3>Amiens, Peace of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed by France and England, in 1801, after the defeat of the
French army in Egypt. England restored all her conquests from France,
Spain and Holland, excepting Ceylon and Trinidad. Both parties agreed to
the evacuation of Egypt, and the independence of Portugal was
guaranteed. This peace was of very short duration, England and France
being at war again in 1803.</p>

<h3>Amistad Case.</h3>

<p>The case of a Spanish slaver in 1839, in which the slaves had broken out
and seized the ship. She was afterwards captured by a U.S. cruiser, and
the Supreme Court declared that the seizure of the vessel by the slaves
was not an act of piracy.</p>

<h3>Amour, Loi d’.</h3>

<p>The name ironically applied to a severely repressive measure against the
Press, introduced in the French Chamber by Peyronnet in 1827.</p>

<h3>Anabaptists.</h3>

<p>A fanatical sect which had its rise in Westphalia, early in the
sixteenth century. In 1535 the Anabaptists seized the city of Münster,
and under their leader Boccold, otherwise John of Leyden, who had
arrogated to himself royal prerogatives, they held out for some time
against the forces of the Bishop of Münster. They were, however,
eventually overpowered, and their leaders put to death. Among other
extreme doctrines, they advocated communism and polygamy.</p>

<h3>Anarchist Riots, Chicago.</h3>

<p>Riots arising out of the Labour agitation in Chicago in the spring of
1886. The Anarchists took advantage of the disturbed condition of the
city, and in the course of a meeting which they summoned, a bomb was

enormous number of baggage animals captured.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Chinese Agreement, 1902.</h3>

<p>An agreement between Great Britain and China providing for the abolition
of <i>Likin</i>, and an increase of duties at the port of entry, to

commercial treaties with China agree to the increase of the import
duties.</p>

<p>A treaty by which Holland surrendered to Great Britain all her
possessions on the Gold Coast.</p>

cession to France of Mongain, and a strip of territory, twenty-five
kilometres wide, on the right bank of the Mekong. Both parties agreed
not to invade the territory left to Siam by this arrangement, and it was
further stipulated that any commercial privileges in Yunnan and
Sze-Chuan accorded by China to either nation should be common to both.</p>

<h3>Anglo-German Agreement, 1890.</h3>

<p>An agreement, fixing the limits of the spheres of influence of the two
Powers in East, West, and South-West Africa, with the exception of the

agreement further provided for the cession of Heligoland to Germany, and
the recognition by the latter of Great Britain’s protectorate over
Zanzibar.</p>

<h3>Anglo-German Agreement, 1900.</h3>

<p>An agreement, also known as the Yang-tse Agreement, signed May 16, 1900,
defining the policy of the two Powers in China. It was agreed to support
the policy of the “Open Door,” and to permit free access for all nations
to the ports, rivers and littorals where the signatories have influence;
to refrain from seeking special territorial advantages, and to oppose
the grant of such to other Powers, the right being reserved to concert
measures in the event of such advantages being sought. Germany has since
declared that she does not consider this agreement to have any bearing
on the Russian occupation of Manchuria.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Italian Agreement, 1885.</h3>

<p>An agreement by which Great Britain recognizes Italy’s rights to the
East Coast of Africa between Massowah and Obock, and further agrees to
give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> her moral support in Tripoli. Italy in return undertakes the
same friendly offices for Great Britain in Egypt.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Agreement, 1902.</h3>

<p>An agreement signed in London, January 30, 1902, by which the relations
of the two Powers in the China seas are defined. It is provided that if
one of the signatories be involved in war, in defence of her interests
in these regions, the other shall maintain a strict neutrality, but that
if the belligerent be attacked by a second Power, the other signatory
shall join her ally, and that the war shall thenceforward be conducted
in common, and peace made only by mutual agreement. It is further
stipulated that neither party shall enter into a separate agreement with
another Power, to the prejudice of the joint interests of the allies,
these interests being defined as the maintenance of the territorial
integrity of China and Korea, and the securing therein equal
opportunities for the commerce of all nations.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Treaty, 1895.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Great Britain and Japan, signed in 1895, abolishing
extra-territorial jurisdiction in Japan for British subjects. Great
Britain was thus the first European nation to acknowledge the entry of
Japan into the comity of nations. The treaty became operative in 1899.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Portuguese Treaty, 1891.</h3>

<p>Following the disturbances on the Mashonaland border, where a collision
had taken place between Portuguese troops and British South African
Police, an ultimatum was despatched to Portugal, demanding the
withdrawal of her troops from the disputed territory. A treaty was
subsequently signed delimiting the spheres of influence of the two
Powers and declaring the navigation of the Shiré and the Zambesi open to
all nations, while Portugal agreed to facilitate communication by these
and other river and land routes.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Russian Convention, 1825.</h3>

<p>A convention by which it was agreed that both Powers should enjoy equal
fishing rights in the Pacific Ocean. A line of demarcation was also
drawn between Alaska and British Columbia, but it was never properly
demarcated, and the vagueness of the boundary has been a fruitful source
of dissension between England and the United States, probably to be
ended by the Alaska Treaty of 1903.</p>

<h3>Ankarström’s Conspiracy.</h3>

<p>A conspiracy of Swedish nobles, headed by Counts Ribbing and Horn and

masquerade in the Opera House at Stockholm on March 16, 1792.</p>

<h3>Annates.</h3>

<p>The first year’s income of a benefice, claimed as tribute by the Popes.
This and all other tributes to the Roman See were abolished in England

<h3>Annunziata.</h3>

<p>An Italian order of knighthood, holding the third place (after the

restricted to twenty members, exclusive of royal knights.</p>

<h3>Annus Mirabilis.</h3>

<p>A party among the Irish Catholics, who declined to sign the Petition of
Remonstrance, drawn up by Peter Walsh, in 1666, protesting against the
belief prevalent in England that toleration of Catholicism was
incompatible with the safety of the State.</p>

<h3>Anti-Semitism.</h3>

<p>An anti-Jewish crusade which broke out in Eastern Europe in the latter
part of the nineteenth century. It was especially virulent in Russia and
Austria, while in Germany an Anti-Semitic League was formed in Berlin in
1880, to “prevent the Judification of Germany.” The Judenhetze, as it
was called, was carried to such lengths as to call for the interference
of the Emperor. Still later the crusade against the Jews extended to
France, where the anti-Semitic party is strong. As a consequence of this
persecution, thousands of Jews have emigrated from the Continent to
England and to the United States.</p>

<h3>Anti-Slavery Society.</h3>

<p>A society formed at Philadelphia in 1833, under the presidency of

<h3>Apprentices, Statute of.</h3>

<p>A statute of Elizabeth, passed in 1563, by which no person was permitted
to exercise a trade in England unless he had previously served an
apprenticeship to it of seven years.</p>

<h3>Apprenticeship (Transvaal).</h3>

<p>This question was much debated in England in the early seventies, some
people alleging that the apprenticeship of black children was a covert
form of slavery, especially as indentures were transferable before a
landdrost. On the annexation of the country in 1877, however, it was
found that the charge was quite groundless.</p>

<h3>Arabi’s Rebellion.</h3>

<p>This revolt arose originally from a quarrel between the Circassian and
the Arab officers of the Egyptian Army in 1881. Three Arab colonels, one
of them Arabi, headed a successful mutiny, demanding a change at the
Ministry of War, which was controlled entirely by the Circassians. Later
in the year further trouble arose, and Arabi, supported by the whole
army, obtained the appointment of Under Secretary, and subsequently that
of War Minister. By June, 1882, he was practically a military dictator,
and commenced fortifying Alexandria. An ultimatum from the British
Government was without effect, and Alexandria was bombarded by the
British fleet. The defeat of Arabi at Tel-el-Kebir put an end to the
rebellion.</p>

<h3>Aragon, Privilege of.</h3>

<p>A charter granted to the nobles of Aragon by Alfonso III in 1287. It
gave them a constitutional right to federate against the king, if he

<h3>Arima, Rebellion of.</h3>

<p>A rising of his dependents against the Daimio of Arima, which was joined

<h3>Arkansas Civil War.</h3>

<p>A dispute, in 1874, between the factions of Brooks and Baxter, each of

side.</p>

<h3>Armagnacs.</h3>

<p>The party of the Orleans Princes in the French civil war, which broke
out in 1410, during the reign of the imbecile Charles VI. Their
opponents, the Burgundians, succeeded in obtaining possession of Paris
by treachery in 1418, and the Armagnac leaders were captured and thrown
into prison. The Paris mob, always hostile to this party, broke into the
prisons and murdered all the prisoners. In this affair, which is known
as the Massacre of the Armagnacs, it is said that 3,500 persons
perished, including the Comte d’Armagnac, the Chancellor, and many
nobles and members of the Parlement.</p>

<h3>Armed Neutrality.</h3>

<p>A league of the northern nations of Europe, formed under the leadership
of Prussia and Russia in 1870, to contest the right of search exercised
by British ships of war over neutrals. The contentions of the league
were that the flag covers the merchandise, except in the case of
contraband of war, and that a blockade must be effective to be
respected.</p>

<h3>Armenian Massacres.</h3>

<p>In 1895 and 1896 terrible massacres of the Armenians took place in
Anatolia, at the hands of the Kurds, who were probably aided, and
certainly not hindered, by the regular Turkish garrison. In 1896, on the
ground that a dangerous conspiracy was on foot, the authorities connived

who could read, but with the spread of education after the Renaissance,

Bourbons in 1867.</p>

<h3>Campo Formio, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between France and Austria, following Napoleon’s successful
campaign in Northern Italy, signed in 1797. France secured possession of
the Belgian provinces, the left bank of the Rhine, and the Ionian

<h3>Canadian Fisheries Question.</h3>

<p>A long-standing dispute between Canada and the United States, dating
from the treaty of peace of 1783, when American fishermen were given
fishing rights on the coast of Canada. The Americans claimed that this
right was inalienable, England that it was forfeited during the second
war. In 1818 a <i>modus vivendi</i> was arrived at by which the Americans
were allowed to fish outside the three mile limit, but friction still
continued till 1871, when a treaty was signed at Washington giving the
two countries reciprocal rights. Canada maintained that the right to
fish off the American coast was of little value to her, and in 1877 a
commission was appointed, which met at Halifax, to assess the damage she
had sustained. The award of the commission was that Canada and
Newfoundland should receive five and a half million dollars as
compensation.</p>

<h3>Canons of 1604.</h3>

<p>The new canons, issued by Convocation in 1604, contained regulations for
the conduct of public worship. They excommunicated all who attacked the
Prayer Book, the Thirty-nine Articles, or the Supremacy of the Crown, as

validity, but not the force of an Act of Parliament.</p>

<h3>Canossa.</h3>

<p>The castle of Matilda of Tuscany, where Gregory VII was staying when the
Emperor Henry IV made a pilgrimage to Italy, in 1077, to make his
submission to the Pope, who had excommunicated him. He was treated in
the most humiliating fashion by Gregory, who left him for three days in
the snow in the courtyard of the Castle before consenting to receive
him. It is to this incident that Bismarck referred in the famous phrase,
“Nach Canossa gehen wir nicht” (We are not going to Canossa), uttered in
the Reichstag in 1872, during the Kulturkampf.</p>

<h3>Canossa Bill.</h3>

<p>A bill introduced into the Prussian Landstag in 1880, making great
concessions to the Catholic clergy, but maintaining the supremacy of the
State over the Church.</p>

<h3>Capitularies.</h3>

<p>The edicts of the early French Kings were so called.</p>

<h3>Capitulations.</h3>

<p>Arrangements by which foreigners are subject to the jurisdiction of

<p>The supporters of Don Carlos and his branch of the Bourbon family, as
claimants to the Spanish throne. Don Carlos was the younger brother of
Ferdinand VII, and under the constitution of 1812 should have inherited
the throne, as the female succession was excluded. In 1832, however,
Ferdinand, who had already, by a decree which he subsequently withdrew,
readmitted the principle of female succession, finally settled the crown
on his daughter Isabella, who succeeded in the same year, with her
mother, Christina, as regent. Don Carlos was exiled, but various risings
have since taken place in support of his claims, chiefly in the Biscayan
provinces, including the first Carlist War, which lasted till 1840.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span></p>

Innocent IV. in 1247.</p>

<h3>Carolina, Proprietaries of.</h3>

<p>The original landowners of Carolina, to whom the Colony was granted by
Charles II in 1643. They were eight in number, among whom were

<h3>Caroline Islands Arbitration.</h3>

<p>In 1885 Germany endeavoured to establish a protectorate over the
Caroline Islands, which Spain claimed to have been under her dominion
since the seventeenth century. Germany disputed this claim and occupied
Yap. Matters became very serious, and the two countries were on the
verge of war. It was, however, finally agreed to submit the question to
the Pope, who gave his award in favour of Spain, as to the sovereignty,
but allowed to Germany free trading and colonizing rights.</p>

<h3>Caroline Ordinance.</h3>

<p>A codification of the criminal laws of Germany, issued by the Diet of
Ratisbon, in the name of Charles V, in 1532.</p>

of them with the object of getting returned for Congress by the aid of
the negro vote. The name was intended to convey the idea that they had
no stake or interest in the country, beyond the baggage they carried
with them.</p>

<h3>Cartel System.</h3>

<p>A system prevailing in Germany and Austria, by which a ring of sugar
manufacturers, aided by heavy import duties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> combine to obtain very
high prices for all sugar consumed at home. They utilize the large
profits thus secured to ship the surplus sugar below cost price, thus
securing for themselves all unprotected markets.</p>

<h3>Cartellpartie.</h3>

<p>A party in the German Reichstag, formed in 1888, by a coalition of the
Conservatives and the old National Liberals, and pledged to support

near Grenoble. The Charterhouse, in London, was formerly one of their
monasteries.</p>

be decided only by the Royal Bailiffs, or by the Parlement.</p>

<h3>Casenbrotspel.</h3>

<p><i>See</i> Bread and Cheese War.</p>

<h3>Casket Letters.</h3>

<p>A series of letters and sonnets, purporting to be written by Mary Queen
of Scots to Bothwell, and left behind by him when he fled from Edinburgh
in 1567. If genuine, these letters undoubtedly prove Mary to have been
privy to the murder of Darnley.</p>

<h3>Cassini Convention.</h3>

<p>A secret treaty between Russia and China, supposed to have been signed
in 1896, by which Russia secured certain definite rights over Manchuria.
She has since made several attempts to replace this agreement by a
public treaty, but has been prevented by the opposition of the Powers.
Russia’s present position in Manchuria, therefore, is correct so far as
China is concerned, but has not been acknowledged by the other Powers.</p>

throne as his successor. She succeeded in getting herself recognized by
the nobles as Catherine II, and in 1762 the conspirators, headed by one
of the Orloffs, strangled Peter III at a house near Peterhof.</p>

<h3>Catholic Association.</h3>

<p>An association formed by Daniel O’Connell in 1823, to press the claims
of the Irish Catholics upon Parliament. It held entirely aloof from all

declaring it an illegal association.</p>

<h3>Catholic Emancipation Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1829, substituting for the old formula, which included
abjuration, a new form of oath, and thus enabling Catholics to sit in
either House. It opened to them all offices under the state, except
those of Regent, Lord Chancellor, Viceroy of Ireland, and Royal
Commissioner of the General Assembly of Scotland. The Roman Catholic

<h3>Cecil’s Fast.</h3>

<p>The name given to an Act passed by Cecil, Lord Burleigh, after the

year, was so named by Louis XVIII.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<h3>Champ de Mars.</h3>

<p>The annual meetings of the Franks for military purposes during the early
times were held during the month of March. At a later period the month

<h3>Chartism.</h3>

<p>An agitation which broke out in 1837 and culminated in the Chartist
riots of 1839. It was probably due to the declaration by the Liberal
party that they were satisfied with the results of the Reform Bill of
1832, and did not intend to press for further reform in this direction.
The movement takes its name from the “People’s Charter,” a manifesto
setting forth the aims of the agitators. This Charter demanded manhood

electoral districts. The most prominent Chartists were Feargus O’Connor,
Frost, and Williams.</p>

Geneva. This edict also established the Chambre Ardente.</p>

<h3>Châtillon, Congress of.</h3>

<p>A congress opened at Châtillon on February 5, 1814, to treat with
Napoleon as sovereign of France. The allies, however, found his demands

the terms that the allies were at first prepared to grant.</p>

<h3>Chauffeurs.</h3>

<p>Bands of brigands, who in 1793 infested the northern and afterwards the

<p>Originally an unreasoning admiration for Napoleon, the name being taken
from Chauvin, a character in Scribe’s “Le Soldat Laboureur.” At the

Jingoism.</p>

1698, 1,200 colonists started for Darien, but were at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> opposed by
the Spanish colonists, and though a further expedition was dispatched in
the following year, the whole enterprise failed ignominiously. The
scheme had from the first been opposed in England, and was the cause of
much bad blood between the two countries, and of a heavy pecuniary loss
to Scotland.</p>

by the Queen, for a diamond necklace, which the Cardinal ordered from
the Court jeweller, giving bills for payment by instalments. Madame
Lamothe, by means of another forged document, obtained possession of the
necklace, and turned it to her own uses. The Cardinal being unable to
meet the first bill when it became due, the jeweller applied to the
Queen. The matter came to the ears of the King, who ordered an inquiry,

to supersede the Charter of 1663.</p>

<h3>Draft Riots.</h3>

<p>An outbreak in New York in 1863, to resist the drafting of New Yorkers

<p>In December, 1894, Captain Dreyfus, a Jewish artillery officer, employed
at the General Staff in Paris, was found guilty of supplying
confidential documents to foreign Powers, and sentenced to degradation
and transportation for life. His friends were convinced of his
innocence, and began an agitation which by degrees attracted the
attention of many eminent Frenchmen, among others Emile Zola, who took
up his cause with great warmth. Eventually the Government were forced to
submit the case to the Cour de Cassation, which quashed the conviction
and ordered a new trial. Dreyfus was brought back to France in 1899, and
tried by court-martial at Rennes. Though his innocence was generally
believed in outside France, he was again found guilty, but was almost
immediately pardoned by the President. The Case was the occasion of a
wild outburst of anti-semitism in France. In February, 1903, it was
rumoured that the case was to be re-opened by the Dreyfusites, evidence
having come to light of the methods adopted by the General Staff to
secure the second conviction.</p>

thereupon unloaded their merchandise at the frontier, and sent it on to
Johannesburg by waggon. President Kruger then closed the drifts, or
fords, on the Vaal on October 1. He was reminded that this action was a
breach of the London Convention, but he remained obdurate, and it was
found necessary to resort to a display of force, before which he gave
way.</p>

<h3>Drogheda, Statute of.</h3>

<p>Generally known as Poyning’s Act.</p>

<h3>Drunken Parliament.</h3>

<h3>Dual Alliance.</h3>

<p>The alliance at present existing (1903) between France and Russia. Its
earliest form was a military convention, signed in 1891, whereby it was
stipulated that either nation should, with a specified force, assist in
repelling an attack on the other by Germany. This convention was
extended in 1894, and in 1897 became a definite alliance, for defensive
purposes only, wherein all special reference to Germany is dropped.</p>

<h3>Dual Control.</h3>

<p>The control by England and France of the Egyptian finances established
by a decree of September 4, 1879, which provided that the
Comptrollers-General of the two Powers should have the rank of Egyptian
Ministers, and the right to attend, but not to vote at, meetings of the

Norsemen by King Knut.</p>

<h3>Dukhobors.</h3>

<p>A Russian sect, claiming to live without submitting themselves to human
laws, and without reference to any other authority than that of God. The
refusal to undergo military service led to their expulsion from Russia,

authorities no little trouble by their refusal to submit to the law of
the land.</p>

<h3>Dulcigno Arrangement.</h3>

tribes of Saxons and Danes were united under one administration. Knut
re-established Eadgar’s Law on his accession in 1016.</p>

<h3>East India Company.</h3>

<p>The first charter to the Indian merchants was granted in 1600, and made
perpetual in 1609, a company being constituted under the title of the
India Company, with the monopoly of the Eastern trade. During the
Revolution a rival company was formed whose competition threatened to
extinguish the older Company, but eventually the two were amalgamated in
1708. As the field of operations in India was extended, political
questions became increasingly important, and such was the
maladministration of the Company, that the Government was constantly
forced to interfere. In 1773 a Regulating Act was passed, by which a new
council was appointed and other administrative reforms introduced, but
the consequent improvement was not marked, and in 1784 Pitt’s India Bill
withdrew all political power from the hands of the Company, while
leaving their trading rights intact, and established a Board of Control,
to be appointed by the British Government. In 1813 the trading monopoly
of the Company was broken, so far as India was concerned, by the
admission of independent traders to the Company’s territories, but they
still retained the China trade. In 1834, however, the restrictions on
trade still afforded by the Company’s charter were felt to be out of
harmony with modern commercial ideas, and the whole of the Company’s
trading rights were swept away, in return for an annuity, payable for
forty years, of £630,000, redeemable at the end of that period, at the
Government’s option, for a sum of £12,000,000. Before that period was
ended, however, the Indian Mutiny broke out, and on its suppression, in
1858, the Company was finally dissolved, and India passed under the
direct rule of the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Economists.</h3>

<p>A philosophical school, or sect, founded in France about 1761 by a

purposes of secular education.</p>

<p>The nobles and other Royalists, to the number of 123,000, who left
France during the Revolution. Their estates were forfeited, and owing to

<h3>Employers’ Liability Bill, 1893.</h3>

<p>A bill rendering employers liable for compensation to their workmen for
injuries received while at work. The bill was not passed, being wrecked
by the question of “contracting out.” Many large employers of labour had
arrangements with their men, by which the latter contributed to an
assurance fund, maintained in the main by the employer, for the purpose
of providing compensation for injury, the men being bound, under these
conditions, not to take legal action for compensation. The House of
Commons passed a clause rendering such contracts illegal, but the Lords
inserted an amendment rendering them legal under certain safeguards as
to the amount of the employers’ contribution to the fund, etc. Neither
party would give way, and the bill was withdrawn.</p>

<h3>Employers’ Liability Act, 1897.</h3>

<p>An Act providing compensation for death or injury, to workmen or their

that year, Captain Marchand, after an adventurous journey from the
French Soudan, reached Fashoda on the Nile, and hoisted the French flag
there and at certain points on the Sobat river. Sir Herbert Kitchener,
who had just captured Khartoum, invited Marchand to withdraw, and
hoisted the English and Egyptian flags. Marchand refusing, the matter
was referred to London and Paris. The French were at first inclined to
hold that, the Anglo-Egyptian occupation of the Soudan having been
suspended by the Mahdist domination, it was open to them to make a
settlement on the Nile. It was clearly proved, however, that they had
been warned on several occasions that this would not be permitted, and
after some hesitation, due probably to the doubt as to whether they
would have the support of Russia if they stood firm, they yielded, and
the Marchand expedition was withdrawn.</p>

attempted a raid into Canada, which was entirely unsuccessful. In 1867 a
general rising in Ireland was planned, which also failed. Two further
unsuccessful attempts upon Canada took place in 1870 and 1871, from
which point its activity was confined to a few isolated outrages of

was the owner of the whole country, which was held in fief, or
vassalage, by the great territorial lords, who owed him homage and
service, military or other. They in turn had vassals of lesser degree,
bound to them by similar ties, but, subject to the due discharge of such
service, perfectly free. By the growth of “subinfeudation” this system
became indefinitely extended.</p>

went back on his word, and gave Charles V an undertaking that he would
proceed no further in the matter.</p>

<h3>French Shore.</h3>

<p>A question still (1903) pending between Great Britain and France. By the
Treaty of Utrecht, 1713, Newfoundland was declared English, but the
French were suffered to retain their fishery rights and the use of a
certain portion of the coast for drying stations. France has for many
years sought to give a very wide interpretation to this use of the
Newfoundland coast, claiming almost sovereign rights, which seriously
interfere with the railway and mining development of the colony. A
<i>modus vivendi</i> has been arrived at, pending final settlement, but the
long delay in coming to an agreement has caused much irritation in
Newfoundland.</p>

<h3>Frèrage.</h3>

<p>The system by which in French feudal times provision was made for the

selling price of the commodities in which they dealt.</p>

<h3>Fronde.</h3>

<p>A revolt of the Parlement and citizens of Paris, under the leadership of
the Cardinal de Retz, against the unrestrained autocracy of Louis XIV.
The court was forced to leave Paris in 1648, but the first outbreak was
ended during the year following by an arrangement called the Treaty of
Ruel. It was finally suppressed in 1652. The contention of the Fronde
was that the king’s prerogative should only be exercised within the
limits of the law, and should not be above the law, as was claimed by
the king.</p>

<p>A circular issued by the Admiralty in 1876, which gave instructions to
the captains of H.M. ships as to the treatment of slaves who took refuge
on board in the territorial waters of slave-holding states. These
instructions were held to be inconsistent with the principle that there
could be no slavery under the British Flag, and a strong feeling was
aroused in the matter. Eventually a committee was appointed to examine
the legal aspects of the question, with the result that a modified
circular was issued.</p>

<h3>Fugitive Slave Law.</h3>

<p>A law forming part of the Compromise Act, passed by Congress in 1850,

two branches, and two sovereigns, namely, the King of Spain and the
Emperor of Austria.</p>

Ruthven, in 1600, to murder James VI of Scotland. It is supposed that
their motive was to avenge the death of their father, who had been
executed sixteen years before, though both the brothers had been treated
with the greatest kindness by the King. James was decoyed to Gowrie
House, in Perth, on the plea of examining a suspicious prisoner, and was
attacked in the absence of his suite, and nearly overpowered. He managed
to give the alarm, and was rescued by Sir James Ramsay, his page, and
others of his followers. The King’s story was at the time doubted by
many people, but documents afterwards came to light proving the
existence of a plot at least to kidnap the King.</p>

<p>The ostensible cause of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857 was the issue to the
native troops of cartridges for the newly issued Enfield rifle, which
were said to be greased with a mixture of cows-fat and hogs-lard. This

Empire in 1871.</p>

<p>The method of suicide adopted in old Japan by members of the Samurai, or
military class, who had no alternative but to die. Hara-kiri might be
either voluntary, or by order of a feudal lord, as the penalty of some

<p>In old Japan, the retainers of the Shôgun were known by this name, which
signifies “under the flag.” They were eighty thousand in number. Those
whose lands were of a certain extent furnished a contingent in time of
war; those with smaller revenues paid money dues. The Hatamotos may be

result that judicial functions were frequently exercised by persons
having no legal knowledge or aptitude. By this Act these powers were
transferred to sheriffs-depute, one being appointed for each county.</p>

<h3>Hermandad.</h3>

<p>A confederation of the principal cities of Castile, formed during the

clearly show that its aims were revolutionary, and it was largely
concerned in fomenting the disturbances which preceded the Armenian
massacres of 1895-6.</p>

<h3>Hinterland Doctrine.</h3>

<p>A doctrine enunciated by Germany to the effect that in newly-occupied
countries, such as East or West Africa, the possession of the coast line
implied a right to the back country, to be taken up at convenience, and

the way into the interior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span></p>

<p>An alliance formed between Russia, Austria and Prussia in September,
1815, by which the three sovereigns undertook that for the future their
policy should be guided solely by Christian principles. At the same time
there is no doubt that the alliance was intended to stem the tide of
political liberty, set flowing by the French Revolution, and their
threatened interference in the quarrel between Spain and her American
colonies, which was the cause of the enunciation of the Monroe doctrine,
is a sufficiently clear indication of this fact.</p>

<p>The name given to William Penn’s experiment of establishing (in
Pennsylvania) a colony on the basis of absolute self-government, as a
free colony of all mankind.</p>

invasions, was to a great extent restored by Charlemagne, who was
crowned its first Emperor by Leo III in 800. After the extinction of the
Carlovingian line, the Emperors were exclusively German Princes, and
were elected to the throne by the sovereign rulers of certain German
States, though the Popes always claimed, and sometimes exercised, the
right of veto, by refusing to crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> In 1272 the first Emperor of the
House of Hapsburg, Rudolf, was elected, and from 1438 the Emperors were
without exception members of this house, until the Empire was finally
broken up by Napoleon in 1806.</p>

<p>The first Home Rule Bill, introduced by Mr. Gladstone, providing for the
creation of a legislative body in Dublin, with control of the
administration, subject to safeguards as to the unity of the Empire, and
the protection of minorities. It was to have control of all taxation,
except of customs and excise, but was forbidden to legislate on any
matter relating to the crown, defence, or foreign relations, or to endow
any religious bodies. The Irish representation at Westminster was to be
abolished. The bill divided the Liberal Party, many of Mr. Gladstone’s
Cabinet deserting him, including Lord Hartington, Sir Henry James, Mr.
Bright and Mr. Chamberlain, and consequently it failed to pass the
second reading. The general election which followed proved that the
country was strongly opposed to the scheme.</p>

<h3>Home Rule Bill, 1893.</h3>

<p>The second Home Rule Bill, introduced by Mr. Gladstone in 1893, was to a
great extent on the lines of the first bill, creating a Parliament in
Dublin, with legislative powers subject to certain reservations as to
peace and war, external affairs, etc. In one respect, however, it
differed widely, in that the Irish Parliamentary representation at
Westminster was not abolished, but merely reduced. The bill passed the
Commons after lengthy and acrimonious discussion, especially in
Committee, where Mr. Gladstone introduced the system of “Closure by
Compartments,” but was rejected by the Lords.</p>

<h3>Home Rulers.</h3>

war in July of the same year. The Dutch afterwards conceded the claim by
the Treaty of 1654.</p>

Independence in 1849.</p>

<h3>Hungarian War of Independence.</h3>

<p>A rising of the Hungarian national party under Kossuth, in 1848, owing
to the refusal of the Austrians to give any redress for the outrages of
the Croatian troops under Jellachich in the valleys of the Theiss and
the Danube. Kossuth was appointed Dictator by the Hungarian Diet, and
the rising was at first successful, but in 1849 the Austrians received
the assistance of a large Russian army, and in August of that year, the
Magyars were forced to surrender, and their leaders left the country.
General Hainau made himself notorious by his cruelties after the
collapse of the armed resistance.</p>

Alexander V in 1412, he continued to disseminate these doctrines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span> and
was consequently summoned to the Council of Constance in 1414, where,
though under the Emperor’s safe-conduct, he was thrown into prison, and
subsequently burnt at the stake. His principal disciple, Jerome of
Prague, suffered the same fate in 1416, but his followers, under John
Zisca, rose in revolt against the Church, to the number of 40,000. They
destroyed some five hundred convents, and defeated the Emperor
Sigismund, but were broken up into sections in 1424, following upon
Zisca’s death. They still, however, remained in insurrection until 1436,
when the revolt was ended by the treaty of Iglau.</p>

<h3>Hyde Park Riots.</h3>

<p>A riot which broke out in 1866, after the defeat of the Russell Ministry
over the Reform Bill of that year. A meeting had been summoned by the

railings. Little other damage, however, was done, and the riot was
easily quelled.</p>

<h3>Iconoclasts.</h3>

<p>This name was first given to the followers of Leo III, Emperor of the
East, who in 726 interdicted the worship of images. The opposition of a
considerable section of his subjects did not deter him from carrying his
principles into effect, and what is known as the Iconoclast War was the
result. The same title is applied to the more militant Huguenots in
France in 1560 and 1561, who, wherever they obtained the upper hand,
ruthlessly destroyed the statues which adorned the churches and
monasteries, and also to a section of the Puritans during the English
Civil War.</p>

<h3>Iglau, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between the Hussites and the Emperor Sigismund, signed in 1436,
putting an end to the Hussite War. It was based upon the Compactata of
Prague, and secured to the Hussites the free exercise of their religion
on the lines of that document.</p>

<h3>Ilbert Bill.</h3>

<p>A bill introduced in the Legislative Council of India by Mr. Ilbert in
1883 “to amend the criminal jurisdiction over British subjects.” It

generally known as I.D.B.</p>

<h3>Illuminati.</h3>

<p>A famous sect of German mystics, founded at Ingolstadt by Adam
Weisshaupt in 1776. It undertook a crusade against<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> Jesuitism and Church
domination generally, but did not hold aloof from politics, its higher
initiates being professed Republicans. It was suppressed by the Elector
of Bavaria in 1785.</p>

<h3>Immigrants Restriction Bill.</h3>

<p>A bill passed in 1901 by the Federal Parliament of Australia in response
to the outcry for a “White Australia.” It prohibits the immigration of
all coloured labour, including the South Sea Islanders, or Kanakas. This
restriction has caused much concern in Northern Queensland, where the
climate is not suitable for white labour, and its enforcement will
destroy the sugar and other industries and render the country almost
valueless.</p>

<h3>Imparani, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed in 1866 after the Basuto War of 1865-66 between the
Orange Free State and Molapo, the son of Moshesh. Molapo surrendered to
the Free State the greater part of his country, and became a vassal of
the State. He further bound himself to render no assistance to any other
Basuto chief who might rise against the Free State.</p>

infringement of their rights, and it was in consequence of their
continued protests that Clement XIV ceased to promulgate it.</p>

<p><i>See</i> Declaration.</p>

<h3>Independents.</h3>

<p>A sect of extreme Puritans, originally identified with the Brownists.
They afterwards became a political party, holding more advanced views
than the Presbyterians, who represented a conservative form of

the aid of the army, which was mainly officered by them, they became the
predominant party in the state.</p>

commercial rights under their Charter were not interfered with.</p>

<h3>Indian National Congress.</h3>

<p>An annual congress of natives of India, with some few Europeans, whose
object is to promote the extension to India of Western political

<p>A supreme court for American affairs, established in Spain by Ferdinand
in 1511 and reorganized by Charles V in 1524. The council promulgated
all the laws relating to the government of the colonies and appointed to
all colonial offices under the Crown.</p>

<h3>Indulgence.</h3>

<p>A measure of toleration granted to the Scottish Presbyterians in 1669,
by which their ministers were permitted to preach in vacant parishes and
received some pecuniary aid from the Government. This measure, however,
did nothing to reconcile the more bigoted members of the Church, who
continued their resistance to all State control. The Indulgence was soon
withdrawn.</p>

<h3>Indulgence.</h3>

<p><i>See</i> Declaration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<h3>Indulgences.</h3>

<p>Forms of absolution granted by Leo X, which were openly sold by his
agents, the proceeds of the sale being devoted to the completion of St.

III at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. It was introduced into
Germany in 1231, but abolished in 1234, and never again restored. In
Italy it was successful in stamping out heresy, but it is in Spain that
its tyranny was most notorious, an auto-de-fé having been held in that
country as late as 1826. Its administration was entrusted to the
Dominican Order.</p>

<h3>Instrument of Government.</h3>

<p>A document issued by Cromwell in 1653 by which he took the title of
Protector. He was to be assisted by a Council of State of fifteen

<h3>International, The.</h3>

<p>An association of working men, founded in London in 1864, the original
statutes of the society being drawn up by the German Socialist leader
Marx. It was intended as a centre of combination for all workmen’s
societies and unions of every nation, but disclaimed any desire to
interfere with them individually. In 1872 a split occurred in the
society between the Marxists and the followers of the Anarchist Bakunin,
and the International soon after ceased to exist as an organization.</p>

<h3>Irish Church Act, Althorp’s.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1833 abolishing the Church fees, which were paid by
all, whether Churchmen, Catholics or Dissenters, and reducing the number
of Irish bishops from twenty-two to twelve.</p>

<h3>Irish Church Disestablishment.</h3>

<p>An Act for the disestablishment and partial disendowment of the Irish
Church was passed by Mr. Gladstone’s Government in 1869. The Irish
bishops lost their seats in the House of Lords, the Irish Ecclesiastical
Courts were abolished, and the union between the English and Irish
Churches dissolved. The future government of the Irish Church was
entrusted to a synod elected by the clergy and laity. Of the Church
property, valued at about sixteen millions, seven millions were used to
compensate incumbents and to replace the Maynooth Grant and the Regium
Donum.</p>

<h3>Irish Land Act, 1870.</h3>

<p>An Act passed by Mr. Gladstone’s Government giving for the first time a
legal status to the Ulster custom and extending it to all tenancies in
Ireland. The Act provided for compensation for disturbance and
compensation for improvements in the event of the landlord determining a
tenancy, and enacted that improvements should be deemed to be the
tenant’s, the onus of proof to the contrary being thrown upon the
landlord.</p>

<h3>Irish Land Act, 1881.</h3>

<p>This Act, passed in 1881, introduced the principle of judicial
interference between landlord and tenant. It permitted the sale of
tenant right and allowed the tenant to apply to the Court to fix a
judicial rent, such rent to hold good for fifteen years. It made certain
alterations, in the tenant’s favour, in the law relating to compensation
for improvements. It further established a Land Commission with power
(1) to advance money to tenants for the purchase of their holdings, and
(2) under certain conditions to purchase whole estates from the
landlords.</p>

<h3>Irish Land Act, 1885.</h3>

<p>An Act known as Lord Ashbourne’s Act, giving additional facilities for
the purchase by tenants of their holdings. An advance of £5,000,000 was
made to the Land Commissioners for this purpose, while the terms to
purchasers were more generous than those of the Bill of 1881. The
purchase money was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> advanced at 4 per cent., and be repayable in
forty-nine years, while the surplus of the Disestablished Church funds
was to be used as a guarantee to the State against loss.</p>

<h3>Irish Land Act, 1896.</h3>

<p>An Act amending and consolidating the previous Land Acts and dealing
specially with the case of “Town Parks.” It introduced no new principle,
and though the Nationalists tried to secure the valuation of these
holdings at prairie value, the Government carried in the main their plan
for an equitable division between landlord and tenant of any increase of
value due to situation.</p>

<h3>Irish Land Conference.</h3>

<p>A conference held in Dublin in January, 1903, known also as the Dunraven
Conference, between representatives of the Irish Landlords and the
tenants, under the presidency of Lord Dunraven. The conference issued a
unanimous report recommending the abolition of dual ownership by means
of a comprehensive scheme of land purchase. They proposed that the
landlords should be bought out at a price based on their present income
from rent, and that the tenants should purchase at from 15 per cent. to
25 per cent. less, the balance being found by the State, which would
also advance the purchase money, to be repaid by instalments.</p>

Land League, to unite all sections of Irish Nationalists.</p>

<p>A mysterious personage whose face was always covered with an iron mask,
who was confined in the Bastille and other State prisons in France

his identity. It has been contended that he was an elder brother, a twin
brother, and a natural son of the king, Count Matthioli, minister of the
Duke of Mantua, and M. de Marchiel, the head of a wide-spread conspiracy
against Louis XIV, while many other solutions of the problem have been
put forward.</p>

to see these provinces, especially those belonging to Austria, added to
the kingdom.</p>

<h3>Jameson Raid.</h3>

<p>An invasion of the Transvaal by the forces of the British South Africa
Company in January, 1896. Jameson acted on an undated letter, signed by
certain members of the Johannesburg Reform Committee, summoning him to
the aid of the Uitlanders. His raid, however, was ill-timed, the
Johannesburgers being unable to give him the assistance he counted on,
and he was defeated by the hastily summoned Boer commandos. Cecil Rhodes
was a party to the scheme, which was designed to overthrow the corrupt
Boer Government. The Boers made the raid an excuse for increasing their
armaments.</p>

schools, while by the alteration in the form of the Parliamentary oath
in 1858 they were enabled to sit in Parliament.</p>

the status of the Church without the consent of the Estates, and that
any breach of the Constitution by the prince should absolve his subjects
from their allegiance. The charter was abrogated by Joseph II in 1789.</p>

<h3>Judicature Acts, 1873 and 1875.</h3>

<p>By these Acts a Supreme Court of Justice was created, in place of the
various courts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span> existence dealing with various branches of the law.
These Courts were made branches of the High Court of Justice. In the
same way the various appeal courts were brought into one general Court

thereupon. The regulations of these guilds were often exceedingly
oppressive.</p>

to trial for kidnapping, and the disclosures in the case caused the
Government to appoint a commission in 1884 to investigate the whole

thought, and in all the instances which were brought to light the
natives were returned to their islands, and the planters compensated for
the loss of their services.</p>

Valley and the passes into Kashgaria and Yarkand. It further stipulated
that Russia should enjoy the use of an overland route to Hankow for
Russian merchants, and the free navigation of the Sungari River, which
practically opened the whole of Manchuria to Russian trade. Chang How,
who had negotiated this treaty, was disgraced, and China refused to

other stipulations of the treaty of 1880 remaining practically
unaltered.</p>

the Christian religion and its churches, and to permit the Russian
Minister to make at all times representations on behalf of the new
church in Constantinople, such representations to be taken into
consideration as proceeding from a sincerely friendly Power. In this
clause lay the germ of the Crimean War, for Russia interpreted it as
giving her the right to interfere for the protection of all Christians
of the Greek Church in the Turkish Empire.</p>

control of their own municipalities, while a special County of London
was created, comprising all the newer suburbs.</p>

serve the old sentence as well as the new.</p>

<h3>Lollards.</h3>

<p>A religious sect, followers of Wycliffe, which arose in Edward III’s
reign. They attacked the abuses of the Church, and especially the
wealthy religious orders, and claimed the right of private
interpretation in matters of doctrine. They are said to have numbered,
at one time, fully one-third of the population of England. In spite of
continued persecution, the sect remained powerful through several
reigns, and they doubtless paved the way for the ready acceptance by
England of the Reformed Doctrines in the reign of Henry VIII.</p>

withdrew from the convention.</p>

<h3>London Convention, 1884.</h3>

<p>A convention between Great Britain and the Transvaal, amending the
Convention of Pretoria of 1881. All direct reference to the suzerainty
was omitted, but it was expressly stipulated that no treaties should be
negotiated with Foreign Powers (excepting the Orange Free State), or
with native chiefs, without the consent of Great Britain. The suzerainty
was thus maintained in fact, as Great Britain retained full control of
the foreign relations of the Transvaal. Provision was also made for the
presence of a British Resident at Pretoria, and certain questions of
frontier were re-adjusted.</p>

<h3>London, Treaty of, 1674.</h3>

<p>The treaty between England and Holland closing the war of 1672, which
arose out of England’s claim that foreign ships should salute her flag

divided between the two maritime Powers.</p>

<h3>Loose-Coat Field.</h3>

<p>The name given to the battle near Erpingham, in Rutlandshire, in 1470,
where Edward IV defeated the rebels under Sir Thomas Wells.</p>

<h3>Lorcha “Arrow.”</h3>

<p>The boarding of this vessel, flying the British flag, in the Canton
River in 1856, and the arrest of twelve of her crew on a charge of
piracy, led to the war with China in 1857-8, when the English were aided
by the French. The war resulted in the reception of British and French
legations at Peking, and the concession of certain additional privileges
to traders and missionaries.</p>

<p>A confession of the Catholic Faith, drawn up by the University of
Louvain by order of Charles V in 1544. All Charles’ subjects in the
Netherlands were required to conform to these articles, under pain of

<p>The substitution of an irregular trial for the regular process of law,
common in the Western States of America during the wilder days of the

officers of the law were scattered and hard to come at.</p>

<h3>Lyons, Council of, 1245.</h3>

Joyce, one of the men who had been hanged, and that he had been ordered
by the officials, on pain of capital punishment, to swear away this
man’s life. A searching inquiry confirmed the justice of the sentence,
but the case was made the pretext for a violent attack in Parliament
upon the Irish Secretary.</p>

<h3>McKinley Tariff.</h3>

the ringleaders, the mutinous officers were forgiven, and allowed to
resume their posts.</p>

Government to institute a searching inquiry, which led to the
suppression, temporarily at least, of the Maffia.</p>

dignity.</p>

<h3>Major-Generals, Cromwell’s.</h3>

<p>Twelve officers, commanding the twelve military districts into which
Cromwell divided England in 1655. They were given command of the

February 27, 1881, which virtually closed the Boer War of that year. The
surrender of the British Government to the Boer demands is generally
known as the “Majuba Surrender,” and the bitter feeling thereby aroused
caused “Remember Majuba” to be a sort of war-cry at the outbreak of the
war of 1899-1902. The Paardeberg surrender on the anniversary of Majuba
in 1900 was hailed as in some degree wiping out the disgrace attached to
the word.</p>

<h3>Malcontents.</h3>

<p>In 1578 the Walloon troops of the Netherlands, being irri<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span>tated by the
promulgation of the Religious Peace, and by their pay being in arrear,
mutinied under the leadership of the Seigneur de Montigny. Attempts to
appease them were fruitless, and eventually, with the support of the
nobles of Hainault and Artois, the mutiny ended in the formation of a
confederacy of the Walloon provinces, pledged to support the
Pacification of Ghent, and owning allegiance to Philip II.</p>

<h3>Malet’s Plot.</h3>

<p>A plot contrived by General Malet and the Abbé Lafone, in 1812, to
dethrone Napoleon. By means of forged papers Malet persuaded a section

by the Senate with the command of the troops. He then proceeded to the
police ministry, where he arrested Savary, the minister, and the prefect
of police. Attempting, however, to dispose in the same way of General
Hullin, the Commandant of Paris, he was overpowered by the General’s
orderlies, and the plot came to an abortive end.</p>

<h3>Malisset, Société.</h3>

<p>A company under the control of the French Government, formed about 1767
to keep up the price of breadstuffs. The company took advantage of the
scarcity to make enormous profits, and it seems clear that Louis XV was
pecuniarily interested in its transactions. About 1774 it became known
as the Pacte de Famine.</p>

<h3>Malta, Knights of.</h3>

<p>An order of religious chivalry, established in Malta in 1104. In 1310

to Malta. They are now known as the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of
Jerusalem, and have become an English order, interesting themselves
specially in ambulance work.</p>

<h3>Malus Intercursus.</h3>

<p>The name given by the Dutch to the Treaty of Commerce between England

cloth throughout the Netherlands. In return Henry VII. agreed to
surrender to Philip all rebels and fugitives from the Burgundian States
captured in his dominions, a provision which was of no benefit to the
Dutch.</p>

success, as he was guilty of the most extraordinary excesses, and was
murdered by his former followers in the course of the month in which the
rising took place.</p>

After arrest he stated that this was only a blind to conceal a plot of
the Papists, documents relating to which would be found hidden in a meal
tub in the house of Mrs. Cellier, a Roman Catholic. This lady was tried
for high treason and acquitted. Dangerfield was condemned to be flogged
from Newgate to Tyburn and back, and died under the lash.</p>

as territories, with the right to decide the slavery question for
themselves.</p>

and had no franchise. North Carolina objected to the model, rose in
revolt, and formed itself into a separate colony.</p>

was to pay the Grisons an annual tribute. The forts in the Valtelline
and Chiavenna were to be razed.</p>

<h3>Monetary Conference, International.</h3>

<h3>Monroe Doctrine.</h3>

<p>A statement of policy in the message to Congress of President Monroe in
1825, to the effect that the United States could not regard with
indifference any further territorial expansion on the part of European
Powers on the American Continent. The occasion for the pronouncement was
the suspected intention of the Holy Alliance to interfere on behalf of
Spain in her struggle with her revolted colonies. Various
interpretations have been given to this doctrine, some, like that of Mr.
Olney, going much further than President Monroe’s words warrant, but it
is now generally held to mean that the United States will consider her
interests involved, if any European Power seeks territorial
aggrandisement in any part of America, or interferes with the internal
affairs of any American State.</p>

the case never got beyond the Grand Jury, who always declined to find a
true bill.</p>

<h3>Moravians.</h3>

<p>A Protestant sect, having its origin in the Hussites, which was very
numerous in Bohemia and Moravia in the sixteenth century. In 1627 they

<h3>Morey Letter.</h3>

<p>A letter purporting to be written by Garfield, on the eve of the
Presidential Election in the United States in 1880, to a large employer

Young. Their advocacy of polygamy was for a long time a bar to the
admission of Utah to the Union, but the enforcement of the Edmunds Act
of 1882 led to the formal abandonment of polygamy as a tenet by the
Mormons in 1890, and Utah was admitted a State in 1896.</p>

Adalbert de Bourbon, demanded to be recognized as the grandson of Louis
XVI, on the ground that his father, Naundorff, was in reality the

told a marvellous story. The courts dismissed his claim.</p>

<p>This form of trade unionism had its rise about 1884. It differs from the

<h3>Nihilists.</h3>

<p>The Russian revolutionary society, an important section of which is in

the manifesto issued after the assassination of the Czar Alexander II in
1881, in which they declare their object to be the amelioration of the
condition of the peasantry, and the introduction of more civilized
methods of government. They go on to say that Russia demands a new
system, and that, their peaceful efforts having only met with
repression, they have been driven to adopt violent means to gain their
ends.</p>

<p>An edict issued in 1629, shortly after the fall of La Rochelle, which,

the constitution.</p>

out<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span>break, and, the sympathies of the French having been enlisted, a
landing by Hoche was attempted at Bantry Bay. This was unsuccessful, and
a little later Humbert, who landed at Killala, was forced to surrender
to Lord Cornwallis. Horrible outrages were perpetrated by the rebels,
and the consequent reprisals gave a most bloodthirsty character to the
whole affair. The rebels were finally defeated at Vinegar Hill, which
put an end to all organized resistance, though there were a few isolated
risings from time to time. Wolfe Tone was captured and condemned to
death, but escaped the scaffold by suicide. Fitzgerald was killed a few

<h3>Nore, Mutiny at the.</h3>

<p>The name usually given to the mutinies in the fleet at the Nore and
Spithead, which broke out in 1797. The discontent, due to real
grievances, first showed itself at Spithead, where Lord Howe, who was in

reinstate the Scottish lords who had been dispossessed on account of
their supporting Edward.</p>

the State. She was arrested and executed in 1534.</p>

<h3>Olney Doctrine.</h3>

<p>An extension of the Monroe Doctrine put forward by Mr. Olney, President
Cleveland’s Secretary of State, in a despatch on the Venezuela boundary
question in July, 1895. He claimed that Great Britain had no right to
interfere on the American Continent, and that, if force was necessary,
British Guiana must rely on her own resources, without calling in aid
from Great Britain. He further maintained that the United States had a
right to insist upon all claims concerning questions of territory being
submitted to arbitration unreservedly, and was justified in taking steps
to satisfy herself that no territory had been or was being unwarrantably
annexed. Lord Salisbury absolutely repudiated this doctrine, and refused

<p>A commission appointed in 1893 to inquire into the opium question in
India. The commission reported in 1895, eight out of nine members
signing the report, to the effect that the use of opium in India was
strictly moderate, that native opinion made no demand for restriction,
that any interference with the growing of opium in the native states
would be unjustifiable, and that the Government of China was perfectly
satisfied with the existing arrangements as to the opium trade. There
was, therefore, in the opinion of the commissioners, absolutely no
ground for legislative interference.</p>

<h3>Opium War.</h3>

<p>The war with China in 1840 is so called, because it arose out of the
action of the Chinese authorities, who in their efforts to stop opium
smuggling, insisted on the forfeiture of the stocks of opium in the
hands of British merchants in China. It resulted in the cession to Great
Britain in perpetuity of Hong Kong, and the opening of Canton, Amoy,
Foochow, Ningpo and Shanghai as treaty ports.</p>

<h3>Ordeal, Trial by.</h3>

<p>This is of Norse origin, and was practised in England in Anglo-Saxon and
early Norman times. The ordeal was of various kinds, one of the most
severe consisting in the accused walking barefoot and blindfold over
red-hot ploughshares. If within a given period the burns so caused were
not healed he was adjudged guilty. The ordeal was forbidden by the
Fourth Lateran Council in 1215.</p>

<h3>Orders in Council, 1807.</h3>

Tuscany, Naples, Dalmatia and the Ionian Islands, declared a blockade
against all ports from which the English flag was excluded, and finally

States were fully justified in using force if they felt themselves
sufficiently powerful.</p>

extended to them, if they had not been concerned in the murder of
Englishmen. This proclamation was considered by Lord Ellenborough unduly
severe, and a controversy arose which nearly led to Lord Canning’s
resignation.</p>

<p>A treaty signed by England, France, Russia, Turkey, Prussia<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span> and
Sardinia, after the close of the Crimean War. It provided for the return
of Kars to Turkey and of Sebastopol to Russia. The Powers agreed to
respect the integrity of Turkey, while the Sultan undertook to issue a
firman ameliorating the condition of his Christian subjects. The Black
Sea was neutralized, and the Bosphorus and Dardanelles closed to ships
of war in time of peace, while the navigation of the Danube was thrown
open to all nations. The treaty also dealt with the laws of maritime
war, and the following principles were accepted by the signatories: (1)
Privateering to be henceforth unlawful; (2) The flag to cover the
merchandise, except in the case of contraband of war; (3) Neutral goods
under an enemy’s flag not to be liable to capture, unless contraband of
war; (4) Blockades not to be binding unless effective. In 1870 Russia
took advantage of the Franco-German War to repudiate the clause

<h3>Parlement.</h3>

<p>The judicial body which succeeded the Cours Plénières, or Baronial
Courts of the early French kings. It was organized by Louis IX, and was
at first without any fixed seat, though under Philip the Fair in 1302 it
was established in Paris and became known as the Parlement de Paris. It
was then composed of two prelates, two nobles, thirteen clerics and
thirteen laymen. Its earliest records are dated 1254. Later, similar
bodies, known also as Parlements, were established in the chief
provincial centres.</p>

<p>To this Parliament of Henry III, in addition to the knights of the
shires, who had been summoned intermittently since the reign of William
the Conqueror, there were summoned, for the first time in English
history, two burgesses from each of the principal cities. The first
regular Parliament, however, in which all the estates of the realm were

<h3>Parnell Commission.</h3>

<p>A commission appointed by Act of Parliament in 1888 to try the charges
brought against Mr. Parnell by the <i>Times</i> in their articles “Parnellism
and Crime.” The gravamen of these charges was that Parnell and other
Irish leaders were insincere in their condemnation of agrarian crime,
and they were based on a series of letters sold to the <i>Times</i> by a
certain Pigott. In one of these letters Mr. Parnell wrote that Mr.
Burke, who was murdered in Phœnix Park, had only got his deserts. Under
cross-examination Pigott broke down, and confessed that the letters were
forgeries. The Commission cleared Parnell and the other Irish members of
the graver charges, but considered their complicity in much of the
lawlessness of the Land League clearly proved.</p>

Netherlands, and the Spanish Indies should pass to the Elector of
Bavaria, the least powerful of the three claimants. France was to
receive Guipuscoa and the two Sicilies, and Austria the Milanese. The
terms of this treaty, though secret, leaked out, and Charles was
persuaded to execute a will leaving the whole of his dominions to the
Bavarian Prince.</p>

<h3>Partition Treaty, Second.</h3>

<p>The death of the Elector of Bavaria having rendered the First Partition
Treaty of no effect, a second treaty was signed by the same three powers
in 1700. By this instrument Spain, the Netherlands and the Indies were
assigned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span> Austrian Archduke, while France, in addition to the two

<p>A secret society formed for the promotion of agricultural interests in
the United States in 1870. Between that date and 1876, when the society

strictly forbidden at their meetings. The members of the society are
known as Grangers.</p>

own pastors, the payment of tithes in kind only, the proceeds thereof to
be devoted to ecclesiastical purposes, the abolition of serfdom, and
free hunting and fishing. In the later stages of the war they were led
by the fanatic Münzer, who proclaimed community of goods. After much
bloodshed the rising was suppressed in the course of the year, Münzer
being killed in battle.</p>

<h3>Pecquigny, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Edward IV and Louis XI, by which the English King
agreed to withdraw his troops from France, on the payment by Louis of

<h3>Penny Post.</h3>

<p>This great reform was introduced in the Budget of 1839, and became
operative on January 10, 1840. Its introduction is due to the
perseverance of Sir Rowland Hill, who after many years of argument, at
last succeeded in convincing the Postal authorities that the increase of
correspondence would more than compensate for the loss occasioned by the
lowering of the rates.</p>

<h3>Pensioned Parliament.</h3>

Leszczynski was supported for the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span> by France, Spain and Sardinia,
Augustus III by Russia and Austria. The war was ended by the Treaty of
Vienna in 1738, Augustus obtaining the crown.</p>

<h3>Political Assessments Act.</h3>

<p>An Act of the United States Congress, passed in 1876, which forbids the
soliciting or receiving of assessments for political purposes from any
person holding an official position under the Government.</p>

<h3>Politiques.</h3>

<p>A party which came into existence in France after the massacre of St.
Bartholomew in 1572, under the leadership of the Montmorency family. It
was composed of Catholics who had no sympathy with the Huguenot
persecutions and desired to extend toleration to their heretic
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<h3>Poll Tax.</h3>

<p>A tax, graduated from £1 to 1<i>s.</i> a head, on every man or woman in
England, imposed in 1380. It caused great discontent, which culminated
in the rising of Wat Tyler and Jack Cade in 1381.</p>

<h3>Pontage.</h3>

<p>A tax imposed on all freemen in feudal times, for the repair and

<h3>Poonah, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between the British and the Peshwa signed in 1817, whereby the
Peshwa recognized the dissolution of the Mahratta Confederacy, and
renounced all his claims on Sindhia, Holkar, the Gaekwar and the Rajah
of Berar. He undertook to hold no communication with foreign princes,
and to provide for the maintenance of a force of 5,000 horse and 3,000
foot. He also relinquished all territorial rights north of the Nerbudda,
and undertook not to interfere in Indian affairs.</p>

<h3>Poor Law Acts.</h3>

<p>The first Act dealing with this question was passed in the reign of
Elizabeth in 1572, and was followed by other enactments which were
consolidated in the Act of 1601. By this Act rogues and vagabonds were
severely dealt with, but workhouses were provided for the relief of the
deserving poor, and parish officers, known as Overseers, appointed to
superintend the working of the Act. This Act of Elizabeth continued in
force till the Poor Law Act of 1832. By that time numerous abuses had
crept into the administration of the Poor Law, resulting in the complete
pauperisation of many parishes, owing largely to the stringency of the
regulations against vagabondage having been relaxed. By the new Act, the
separation between the two classes was rendered definite, relief was
only to be granted to the able-bodied in return for labour, and children
were separated from adult paupers. The machinery was in the main left
unchanged, but small parishes were formed into Unions, and a central
Board of Control was established.</p>

<h3>Popish Plot.</h3>

assassination of the King and the forcible establishment of the Roman
Catholic religion. The arch-informer, Titus Oates, was a renegade
English clergyman, who had been admitted into the Jesuit order. It is
possible that there may have been some such scheme on foot, but the
so-called revelations of Oates and his fellow-informers were nothing but
a tissue of absurdities. Unfortunately, the murder by some person
unknown of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, before whom Oates made his first
deposition, so inflamed the popular mind that no justice could be
expected, and five Catholic peers denounced by Oates were sent to the
Tower, while many innocent priests and others were condemned and
executed.</p>

questions have been very far-reaching.</p>

declared that no Irish Parliament should be convoked until its programme
of legislation had been sanctioned by the English Privy Council, and
attested by the Great Seal. It was afterwards a source of endless
complications between the Irish and English Governments, as it limited
the absolute power of the Lord Lieutenant, and rendered impossible any
policy of the English colony in Ireland to which the Mother Country was
opposed. This Act was temporarily repealed in 1689, re-enacted in 1691,
and finally rescinded in 1782.</p>

Saxony. The latter, in return, agreed to aid Austria in expelling the
Swedes from Germany, thus scandalously deserting his northern ally.</p>

ex-Queen, purporting to be addressed to Athole, as a proof that he was
in correspondence with the exiled Stuarts. Athole had no great
difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span> in clearing himself of suspicion, and Queensberry was forced

subdivided the old constituencies so as to leave only a few two-member
constituencies in the boroughs. All the counties were divided into

<h3>Reform Bill.</h3>

<p>The Great Reform Bill of 1832 abolished no less than fifty-six rotten
boroughs, but its provisions as to redistribution and the franchise
still left the larger share of political power in the hands of the
landowning classes. It was first introduced in 1831, and passed the
Commons by a majority of one, but was rejected by the Lords. A
dissolution followed and, on the new Parliament assembling, the Bill
again passed the Commons, this time by a majority of 109, but was again
rejected by the Lords. The Ministry refused to resign, and the popular
feeling was so strong that the Lords were forced to give way, and the
Bill became law in 1832. In addition to 111 seats obtained by the
disfranchisement of the rotten boroughs, some thirty boroughs were
deprived of one member each. Of the seats thus obtained sixty-five were
distributed among the counties, sixty-five among the larger towns, and
thirteen were allotted to Scotland and Ireland. The borough franchise
was given to ten pound householders, and in the counties the vote was
given to copyholders and leaseholders, and to tenants at will paying £50
in rent.</p>

<h3>Reform Bill of 1867.</h3>

rent in the boroughs, and in the counties all owners of property of £5
annual value and all occupiers paying £12 per annum. Tacked on to it was
a Redistribution Bill which disfranchised certain small boroughs, and
created a corresponding number of new constituencies. It gave an
additional member each to Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool,
and a member to London University.</p>

XI in 1681, and led to the publication of Bossuet’s “Declaration of the
Clergy of France.”</p>

with the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span> authorities, and being defeated, emigrated west in large
numbers and colonized Tennessee.</p>

<h3>Reichenbach, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Great Britain, Russia and Prussia, signed in 1813. It
provided for the maintenance in the field by Prussia of an army of
80,000 men, in return for a subsidy from Great Britain of two-thirds of
a million, while a secret clause stipulated for the restoration of
Prussia to her territorial position in 1806. Russia was to supply an
army of 160,000 men, and receive a subsidy double that of Prussia. There
was to be an issue of paper money, under the joint guarantee of the
three Powers, of £5,000,000 sterling, of which two-thirds was to be at
the disposal of Russia. This treaty may be said to have laid the
foundation of the Grand Alliance, which finally freed Europe from the
domination of Napoleon.</p>

<h3>Reichskammergericht.</h3>

all religions throughout the United Netherlands. It ordered that
churches should be provided by the town authorities for all forms of

belief. This edict caused great discontent in the Walloon provinces, and
was one of the causes of the “Malcontent” rising.</p>

<h3>Remonstrants (Netherlands).</h3>

<p>The followers of Arminius, who in 1610 presented to the States-General a

<p>The revival of learning in Italy in the fifteenth century. It was
largely due to the advent in the West of many Greek scholars who fled
from Constantinople on its capture by the Turks in 1453, and introduced
the masterpieces of Greek literature for the first time to the scholars
of the West. The revival was further aided and stimulated by the
invention of printing, which had recently taken place.</p>

<h3>Repartimiento.</h3>

<p>A system prevailing in Spanish South America, whereby the natives were
divided into districts, for the purpose of forced labour, and Government
depôts provided to supply them with necessaries. This system led to the
most outrageous extortion, the officials forcing on the natives
commodities they did not need, at exorbitant prices. In 1780 the
misconduct of those officials brought about a rising of Indians, under
Condorcanqui, an Inca Cacique, who, however, was captured by the
Spaniards and put to death. The revolt was continued by his cousin,
Andres, the last of the Incas, who captured Sorate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span> and massacred all
the inhabitants. He was, however, shortly afterwards captured, and the
revolt suppressed, but it was not fruitless, for it led to the abolition

<h3>Republicans (U.S.A.).</h3>

<p>One of the two great parties in the United States. The three chief
points in their political creed are Protection, the maintenance of the
Gold Standard, and Equal Rights for the Black and White races. They are
strongest in the manufacturing districts of the East and Centre. Their
opponents, the Democrats, are less united; in the South they are strong
for the suppression of the negro, but by no means united on the other
two questions. In the mining States of the West the question which is
most to the fore is the free coinage of silver, while in the grain and
cattle districts free trade is the rallying cry. The Democrats are also
supporters of States Rights against Federalism, though this is now
rather an academical than an acute question.</p>

<h3>Requests, Court of.</h3>

<p>A court established by Somerset in the reign of Edward VI, to enable

declaring that Catholics only were entitled to benefit by the provisions
of that instrument. The execution of this edict met with strong
opposition from the Protestants, and it was largely instrumental in
bringing about the intervention of Gustavus Adolphus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span></p>

<h3>Resumption Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1700, dealing with the forfeited lands which had fallen
into the King’s hands after the pacification of Limerick. Some of them

of Norfolk, who consented to enter into the scheme. A Catholic rising
was to be engineered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span> which was to be aided by a Spanish invasion,
Elizabeth was to be dethroned, and the Catholic religion restored. The
existence of the plot was discovered through the arrest of one of
Ridolfi’s messengers. His letters being in cypher, the names of the
conspirators were not discovered. A little later, however, Norfolk was
found in treasonable correspondence with Mary’s partisans in Scotland,
the whole scheme was laid bare, and the leaders arrested. Norfolk was
executed in the following year.</p>

<h3>Riel’s Rebellion.</h3>

<p>A rising of Indian half-breeds in Saskatchewan, North-West Canada, in
1885, under Louis Riel, who had been the ringleader of the Red River
Rebellion in 1869. It was easily suppressed by the Canadian Militia, and

of the Charter was effected in 1852.</p>

<h3>Septennial Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1716, prolonging the term of the then existing

payment of a small fee, to leave their villages, subject to the due
payment of their share of the village taxes. The serfs of the nobles
were more like slaves. Some of them were taken as house servants, others

of one-third of their estates, by the adventurers. The majority of the

that the document was repudiated by most of those who were said to have
signed it, including Lords Salisbury, Lorne and Carnarvon.</p>

a lower rate of interest than they had been paying to the annuitants.
The Company then persuaded the holders of Government Annuities to
exchange them for shares in the Company. The plan was fairly successful,
but led to a wild inflation in the value of the shares, and in the
subsequent collapse thousands were ruined.</p>

Philippe proposed as her husband the Duke of Cadiz, believing that such
marriage would prove unfruitful. At the same time the Queen’s sister,
the Infanta, was to be married to the Duc de Montpensier, with the
object of eventually placing the Crown of Spain on the head of a French
Prince. Palmerston proposed that the second marriage should be postponed
until the Queen had issue, to which the King feigned assent, but

consent to the marriages taking place at once, and they were duly
solemnized, causing great indignation in England.</p>

Congress relating to import duties, and the doctrine was held in 1860 to
justify the secession of the Southern States.</p>

General Gordon, and the rebellion was finally suppressed in the
following year.</p>

<p>A treaty between the French and Abd-el-Kader, the Algerian chief, signed
in 1847, and assuring the French domination in Algeria.</p>

<h3>Tahiti Question.</h3>

<p>A serious difficulty which arose between Great Britain and France in
1844, owing to the action of the French in arresting Mr. Pritchard, a
missionary, who was the British Consul in Tahiti, and was very obnoxious
to the Roman Catholics. He was only released on his undertaking to leave
the Pacific. Great indignation was felt in England at this outrage, but
after lengthy negotiations the matter was smoothed over, and
compensation given to Mr. Pritchard.</p>

direct relations with the villages, most of the Talukdars were
dispossessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span> and much discontent was occasioned thereby.</p>

<h3>Tammany Ring.</h3>

<p>The Democratic party in New York City, who have for years kept the
absolute control of public affairs in the city. As a party organization
it grew out of the Tammany Society, an organization founded in 1805,
ostensibly as a charitable institution, and for the promotion of an
extended franchise. In 1871 the connexion of its leaders with the
notorious Erie Ring led to a crusade against the party, headed by the
<i>New York Times</i>, and an inquiry disclosed wholesale jobbery and
corruption in the administration. As a consequence Tammany was totally
defeated at the polls in 1872, but returned to office at the following
election, and remained in power until 1902, when they were again driven
from office.</p>

<h3>Tartar Invasion.</h3>

<p>The invasion of Russia by the Tartars under Genghis Khan in 1237. They

carrying off the inhabitants as slaves. After subjugating the country,
the Tartars contented themselves with demanding an oath of allegiance
and a tribute from the Russian Princes, allowing the free exercise of
the Christian religion, and interfering in no way with the institutions
and customs of the country.</p>

<p>The Boston tea riots are so called.</p>

<h3>Tea-room Party.</h3>

<p>A party of advanced Radicals who opposed Mr. Gladstone’s amendment to
Lord Derby’s Reform Bill of 1867. This amendment would have restricted
the borough franchise to those occupiers whose names were on the rate
book, but would have drawn a line of value below which no house should
be rated. This small party not only defeated Mr. Gladstone, but
succeeded in forcing upon the Government household franchise pure and
simple.</p>

<p>The name given to Father Mathew, the Irish Temperance advocate, circ.

crimes, and was proscribed by Clement V in 1312, and its property
confiscated.</p>

<p>The Reform Bill of 1867, as first introduced, is so called. At a Cabinet
Council held on the day that Mr. Disraeli was to introduce the Bill, it
was found that Ministers were not in agreement, and there were only ten
minutes left to decide what was to be done. It happened that a Bill had
been prepared, proposing a milder measure of reform, and this it was
decided to introduce. It met with little approval from any section, and
was ultimately withdrawn in favour of the original Bill. The story was
some time afterwards told by Sir John Pakington to his constituents, and
the makeshift Bill was promptly christened the Ten Minutes Bill.</p>

the disposal of Fouquier-Tinville and the Revolutionary Tribunal for the
trial of prisoners.</p>

<h3>Terrorists.</h3>

<p>The extreme revolutionary party in Paris in 1848. They demanded, not

is now known as Prussia. This country, which was a fief of Poland, they
held until 1526, when Albert of Brandenburg, then Grand Master, made a

eventually the Barons.</p>

<h3>Thelusson’s Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1800, by which it was made illegal to devise property
to accumulate for a longer period than twenty-one years. It arose from
the will of Peter Thelusson, a wealthy merchant, who left £800,000 to
accumulate until his grandson’s grandson reached the age of twenty-one.
The will led to protracted litigation, and the resulting accumulation
was consequently much less than had been anticipated.</p>

<h3>Theological Controversy.</h3>

<h3>Trafalgar Square Riots.</h3>

<p>A series of disturbances in London in 1887. Meetings, nominally of
unemployed, were held in Trafalgar Square, and addressed by well-known
Socialist leaders, among others John Burns and Cunningham-Grahame. As
these meetings led to disorder and obstruction of the traffic, they were
prohibited by Sir Charles Warren, the Chief Commissioner of Police. The
Socialists insisted on their right to hold the meetings, and the
disturbances culminated on Sunday, November 13th, when a number of
processions on their way to the Square were broken up by the police, and
their leaders arrested, severe fighting taking place at several points.
This, however, ended the rioting, as no further attempts were made to
hold the prohibited meetings.</p>

in Johannesburg in 1892, with the object of securing the franchise and
reforms in general for foreigners settled in the country. In December
1895 it took the name of the Reform Committee, and was largely
instrumental in bringing about the Jameson Raid, which took place at the
end of that month, though it seems evident that the actual moment chosen
for the Raid did not accord with its plans. After Jameson’s defeat the
leaders of the Committee were arrested and tried for treason, four of
them being sentenced to death, though they were afterwards reprieved.</p>

<h3>Treason, Statute of.</h3>

<p>A Statute of Edward III, in 1352, which defines high treason as plotting

Natal, where they established a republic in 1838.</p>

<h3>Trek, Second.</h3>

<p>An emigration of Boer farmers from the country between the Orange river

founded the South African Republic.</p>

claim to the throne of France. It was intended as a counterpoise to the
alliance of Russia, Sweden and Spain. It became the Quadruple Alliance
by the adhesion of Austria in 1718.</p>

<h3>Triple Alliance, 1883.</h3>

<p>In 1879 Germany and Austria entered into a defensive alliance, which
provided for mutual assistance against Russia, and at least a benevolent

Certain alterations having been made in the book, a further Act was

The use of this book having been abolished during Mary’s reign, it was
again made obligatory by an Act of Queen Elizabeth in 1559, and made to
apply to Ireland, while the same course was pursued after the
Restoration in 1662, with the additional proviso that no clergyman might
hold a living who was not ordained by a bishop and prepared to accept
the Prayer Book.</p>

<h3>Unigenitus, Bull.</h3>

<p>A Bull issued by Innocent X in 1653, in condemnation of the Jansenist
heresy.</p>

<h3>Union Catholique.</h3>

<p>A union of the League with the less bigoted Catholics of France, formed
in 1588 on the virtual acceptance by Henri III of the League formulas.</p>

<h3>Union Cellar.</h3>

<p>An underground cellar in the High Street, Edinburgh, where the principal
supporters of the union with England held secret meetings, the feeling
against the union being so strong that they dared not meet openly.</p>

<h3>Union de la France Chrétienne.</h3>

<p>A union formed in 1891 to hinder the movement for adhesion to the
Republic on the part of the Catholic party. Its leaders were M. de

<h3>Union of Calmar.</h3>

<p>By this instrument, promulgated in 1397 by Margaret of Denmark, the
three northern kingdoms of Norway, Sweden and Denmark were united into
one monarchy. It was renounced by Sweden in 1523.</p>

<h3>Union Jack.</h3>

<p>The union flag, when hoisted at the jackstaff of a man-of-war, is so
called. The union flag is composed of the red cross of St. George on a
white ground (England), the white saltire of St. Andrew on a blue ground
(Scotland), and the red saltire of St. Patrick on a white ground
(Ireland).</p>

<h3>Union with Ireland.</h3>

<p>The Act of Union with Ireland was finally passed in 1800. Resolutions in
favour of it had been submitted to the Irish Parliament in 1799, and
though supported in the main by the Irish Catholics, they were opposed
by Grattan, Curran and other Irish leaders, and rejected. Pitt was
determined that in the interests of both countries the union must take
place, and, the Irish Parliament having been dissolved, he succeeded by
unlimited bribery in securing a Parliament containing a majority pledged
to vote for the union. This Parliament met in 1800, and the necessary
resolution was passed by a majority of forty-six.</p>

<h3>Union with Scotland.</h3>

<p>The Parliamentary Union between the two kingdoms was agreed to in 1706,
the terms being settled by commissioners, thirty-one on each side,
appointed for the purpose. The basis of the agreement was that there
should be one kingdom, one Parliament and one Suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span>cessor. The national
flags were to be combined, and the two countries known as the United
Kingdom. The confirming Act was passed by the Scots Parliament in 1706,
by the English in 1707.</p>

monarchy, convened by Frederick William IV in 1847. It sat for eleven
weeks only, and was replaced by the Constituent Assembly summoned to
prepare a constitution in 1848.</p>

<h3>United Irish League.</h3>

<p>A league founded by William O’Brien in the congested districts of the
west of Ireland in 1897. Its ostensible object is to secure an increase
in the size of tenants’ holdings by breaking up grass farms. Its methods
are not free from intimidation.</p>

not.</p>

<h3>Unkiar Skelessi, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Russia and Turkey, signed in 1833, by which, regardless

Bosphorus to the warships of Russia, while the Dardanelles remained
closed to those of every other Power.</p>

<h3>Unlearned Parliament.</h3>

<p>The Parliament of Henry IV, which met at Coventry in 1404, was so called
because it contained no lawyers.</p>

<h3>Unser Fritz.</h3>

<p>Frederick, Emperor of Germany, was called Our Fritz by his subjects.</p>

<h3>Unspeakable Turk.</h3>

<p>A phrase applied to the Ottoman Empire. It was first used by Thomas
Carlyle.</p>

<h3>Useless Parliament.</h3>

<p>The name given to the first Parliament of Charles I. It met in June
1625, was removed to Oxford in August, and dissolved on the 12th of that
month without having transacted any business.</p>

<h3>Uses, Statute of.</h3>

<p>By common law, landed property could only be left to the eldest son, and
it had become the custom to saddle property so left with “uses,” or
charges, in favour of the younger children. This had caused inextricable
confusion as to title, and a statute of Henry VIII,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span> passed in 1535,
forbade the practice. It was very soon repealed.</p>

<h3>Uti Possidetis.</h3>

territories as they may have conquered or become possessed of up to the
signature of the document.</p>

<h3>Utrecht, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed in 1713 between Louis XIV and the allies, England and
Holland, the Emperor not being a party to the instrument, at the close
of the War of the Spanish Succession. By its terms the allies recognized
the Bourbon succession to the Spanish throne, with the proviso that the
two crowns should never be united in one person. Louis acknowledged Anne
and the Protestant Succession. England retained Gibraltar, Minorca and
Newfoundland, the latter subject to the fishery rights of France. Spain
again granted England the Asiento, and certain fortified towns were
given to the Dutch as a barrier in the Netherlands. The Emperor signed a
separate treaty at Rastadt in the following year.</p>

<h3>Utrecht, Union of.</h3>

<p>A union of the various provinces of the Netherlands in 1597, when they
undertook to support each other in opposing the claims of the Spanish
King. The free exercise of the Protestant religion was guaranteed to
Holland and Zeeland. This union may be looked upon as the foundation
stone of the Dutch Republic.</p>

<h3>Uxbridge, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>An attempt on the part of the Presbyterians in Parliament to come to
terms with Charles I in 1645. Negotiations were opened at Uxbridge, the
Parliamentary demands being the abolition of Episcopacy, the
continuation of the war in Ireland, and the control by Parliament of the
Army and Navy and of appointments to the great offices of State. The
King withdrew from the negotiations, owing to the dissensions in
Parliament between the Independents and Presbyterians, which he
anticipated would eventually enable him to obtain better terms.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h3>Vaal, Treaty of the.</h3>

<p>A treaty between the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, signed in
1857, after President Pretorius’ abortive invasion of the Free State.
The two countries mutually acknowledged each other’s independence, with
the Vaal as the boundary between them. The Transvaal repudiated the acts
of Pretorius in his attempt to interfere with the internal Government of
the Free State, while the Free State undertook to use every endeavour to
compel Schoeman and Joubert to cease hostilities, and further agreed to
accord to burghers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span> the Transvaal the same privileges as were granted
to those of Cape Colony and Natal.</p>

<h3>Vaccination Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1898, substituting the use of calf-lymph for the old
arm-to-arm system in public vaccination, and permitting parents who had
a conscientious objection, to withhold their children from vaccination,
on satisfying a magistrate of the same.</p>

<h3>Vagabonds Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in 1704, empowering Justices of the Peace to hand over to
the military authorities, as recruits, all able-bodied men who were
without visible means of subsistence.</p>

<h3>Valtelline, Massacre of the.</h3>

<p>A massacre of the Grisons Protestants in the Valtelline Valley in 1620,
by Robustelli, acting with the connivance of the Austrians and the
Spaniards.</p>

Lord Paramount, as in the case of the great territorial nobles, or upon
a vassal of the Lord Paramount.</p>

<h3>Vassy, Massacre of.</h3>

<p>The massacre, in 1562, of a body of Huguenots who, in accordance with
their strict legal rights, were holding a service outside the town of
Vassy in Champagne. The murderers were the retinue of the Duc de Guise,
and the victims numbered sixty, while over two hundred were wounded.
This atrocity led to the outbreak of the first Huguenot War.</p>

<h3>Vatican Council.</h3>

<p>The Œcumenical Council held in Rome in 1870, at which the dogma of the
Infallibility of the Pope was promulgated.</p>

<h3>Vavassors.</h3>

<p>The name given on the Continent to the vassals of the great feudal
lords.</p>

<h3>Vehmgerichte.</h3>

<p>Secret tribunals established in Germany during the Middle Ages, to try
persons arraigned on capital charges, and to carry out the sentence in
case of conviction. The most famous was that of Westphalia. Any free
born German was eligible as a member, or Freischöffe, and many German
Princes were initiated. The powers of the Vehmgerichte were greatly
curtailed by Maximilian, the original purpose of these tribunals having
been overshadowed by their employment as vehicles of private vengeance,
and they gradually lost all influence, till they were finally dissolved
by Jerome Buonaparte in 1811.</p>

<h3>Veishya.</h3>

<p>The third, or agricultural, caste among the Hindus.</p>

<h3>Vellore, Mutiny of.</h3>

<p>A rising of native troops in the Madras Presidency in 1806, caused by a
change in the headdress of the Sepoy, to whom it was suggested by
agitators that he was to be forcibly Christianized. The rising was soon
suppressed.</p>

<h3>Venezuela Boundary.</h3>

<p>In January 1895 Venezuelan troops crossed the Cuyuni river, part of the
Schomburgk line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span> into British Guiana, and hoisted the Venezuelan flag
in territory which had been occupied by the British colonists for many
years. Obtaining no redress, Lord Salisbury issued an ultimatum,
whereupon Venezuela appealed to the United States to intervene, in
support of the Monroe doctrine. President Cleveland and Mr. Olney took a
high hand, and went the length of appointing an American Commission to
examine into the boundary question. After long negotiation arbitration
was agreed upon, and a treaty settling the details was signed in
February 1897. The award of the arbitrators was issued in 1899, and
practically confirmed the British claim to the Schomburgk line, but gave
Venezuela Barima Point, at the mouth of the Orinoco, and a tract of
country west of the Wenama river.</p>

<h3>Venice, League of.</h3>

<p>A league formed in 1495 between Spain, Austria, Milan, Venice and Rome,
the signatories binding themselves to unite for the protection of any
one of the contracting parties that was attacked, and especially for the
preservation of the States of the Church. It is the first example in
history of a coalition for mutual defence.</p>

<h3>Venner’s Plot.</h3>

<p>A plot of the Fifth Monarchy men in 1660, under Thomas Venner, to
dethrone Charles II. The plan was to seize Whitehall during the King’s
absence, when Venner, a wild fanatic, trusted to Divine help to carry
out the rest of his scheme. The plot failed, and Venner and other
leaders were arrested, but only after a desperate resistance.</p>

<h3>Verdun, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed in 843, after a short conflict, by the three sons of
Charlemagne, Charles the Bald, Louis and Lothair. The eldest son,
Lothair, renounced his right to the paramountcy, and the younger sons
entered into full enjoyment of their territories, the Empire being thus
divided. This treaty marks the division of the Frankish nation into
French and Germans.</p>

<h3>Vereeniging Conference.</h3>

<p>The conference of Boer leaders held at Vereeniging in May 1902, at which
the terms of surrender were discussed and finally accepted. The terms
provided for the immediate laying down of arms by the Boer commandos,
the acknowledgment of the King as their lawful sovereign, the return of
the Boer prisoners as soon as practicable, freedom of surrendered
burghers from all judicial proceedings except for acts contrary to the
usages of war, the use of the Dutch language in the schools, if
demanded, and in the law courts when necessary, and the establishment in
due course of representative government. The British Government further
agreed to provide £3,000,000 as a free gift, towards the re-settlement
of the country, and a loan of unstated amount, on easy terms, for the
same purpose.</p>

<h3>Vernacular Press Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed in India in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span> 1878 to control native newspapers publishing
seditious libels. It gave the Government power to make the editor of a
native newspaper enter into a bond not to print seditious matter, and
also authorized the seizure of plant in the event of non-compliance with
the terms of the bond. The Act was repealed in 1882.</p>

<h3>Verona, Congress of.</h3>

<p>A Congress of the Powers held in 1822, to consider the situation in
Spain. It resulted in the armed intervention of France in the following
year.</p>

<h3>Veronese Vespers.</h3>

<p>A rising at Verona in 1797, during the French occupation. It was
promptly put down, but not before the Veronese had murdered four hundred
French sick and wounded, lying in the hospitals of the town.</p>

<h3>Versailles, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed in 1783 between Great Britain on the one hand, and
Spain, France and the United States on the other, at the conclusion of
the American War of Independence. France retained Tobago, and Spain,
Florida and Minorca, but all other conquests were restored on both
sides. As between Great Britain and the United States, this treaty
simply confirmed the provisions of the Treaty of Peace of 1782.</p>

<h3>Vervins, Treaty of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed in 1598 between Henri IV of France and Philip II of
Spain, after the recovery by Henri of Amiens, which had fallen into the
hands of the Spaniards. By its terms France recovered all the territory
occupied by Spain during the previous ten years, her frontier being
restored to that settled by the Treaty of Câteau Cambrésis.</p>

<h3>Veto.</h3>

<p>Under the Swiss Constitution, the right of the people to reject a law
passed by the Assembly, by means of the Referendum.</p>

<h3>Veto Act.</h3>

<p>An Act passed by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1834,
at the instigation of Dr. Chalmers, declaring it to be a fundamental law
of the Church that no pastor could be imposed on a congregation against
their will.</p>

<h3>Victorian Deadlocks.</h3>

<p>These were three in number, caused by attempts to tack on to the
Appropriation Bill resolutions of a controversial character. The first
occurred in 1865, when the Legislative Council refused to pass the
Appropriation Bill with certain tariff resolutions of a protective
character appended. The Governor thereupon declined to sign warrants for
payments out of the Treasury, and the business of the country was at a
standstill. The Government, however, got out of the difficulty by having
recourse to the banks. The second or great deadlock arose from the
inclusion in the Appropriation Bill of a grant of £20,000 to Sir Charles
Darling, the retiring Governor, in 1867. This was ended by the refusal
of Sir Charles, in July 1868, to accept the grant. The third arose in
1877 over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span> question of payment of members, the council again
refusing to pass the Appropriation Bill with this provision tacked on.
The Government thereupon dismissed a large number of civil servants. A
compromise was, however, arrived at, and the officials reinstated. The
day on which the dismissals took place is known as Black Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Vienna Congress.</h3>

<p>A congress of the Great Powers, held in 1814-15, at which Great Britain,
France, Austria, Prussia and Russia were represented. It confirmed in
its main features the Treaty of Paris of 1815, with the following
additional provisions: one-third of the kingdom of Saxony was
surrendered to Prussia; the Duchy of Posen was retained by Prussia, and
part of Galicia by Austria, while Russia secured the rest of Poland; the
Bourbons were restored in Naples, the Tyrol was given back to Austria,
and certain arrangements made as to the minor German and Italian States.
The Congress further pronounced in favour of the free navigation of
rivers, and of the suppression of the slave trade.</p>

<h3>Vienna Conference.</h3>

<p>A conference of the four Great Powers, held in 1853, with the object of
mediating between Russia and Turkey. A note was drawn up which was
accepted by Russia, but refused by Turkey, the Sultan declining to admit
that Russia’s championship alone maintained the Greek Church in his
dominions. During the sitting of the conference Turkey declared war. It
being found impossible to bring the antagonists to terms, the conference
was dissolved.</p>

<h3>Vienna, Definitive Peace of.</h3>

<p>A treaty signed in 1738 by Austria, France, Spain and Sardinia, after
the War of the Polish Succession. By its provisions Lorraine was ceded
to France, the Duke of Lorraine receiving in exchange the Duchy of
Tuscany. Spain retained Naples and Sicily, and Sardinia obtained Novara
and Tortona, and some other frontier towns.</p>

<h3>Vienna, Peace of.</h3>

<p>A treaty between France and Austria, signed in 1809 after the defeat of
the Austrians at Wagram, by which Austria was despoiled of further
territory for the benefit of France, Russia and Bavaria. Austria also
agreed to recognize Joseph Buonaparte as King of Spain, and to support
the Continental Blockade.</p>

<h3>Vienna, Treaty of, 1725.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Spain and Austria, by which Spain accepted the
Pragmatic Sanction, and agreed to open her ports to German commerce;
while Austria recognized Don Carlos as the successor to the Duchies of
Parma and Tuscany, and undertook to use her influence with England to
obtain the restoration to Spain of Gibraltar and Minorca. There was,
however, a further secret treaty, binding both countries to assist in
the restoration of the Stuarts, while Austria promised aid in compelling
the return of Gibraltar and Minorca, by force if necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<h3>Vienna, Treaty of, 1731.</h3>

<p>A treaty between Austria, Spain, Holland and England. The three latter
powers united in guaranteeing the Pragmatic Sanction, while Austria
agreed to the occupation of Parma and Tuscany by Spanish garrisons.</p>

<p>The name given to an expedition under Sir George Rooke in 1702, when the
English fleet forced an entrance into Vigo Bay, and destroyed the French
fleet, together with the Spanish galleons, which had just arrived with
treasure from America.</p>

<h3>Világos, Surrender of.</h3>

<p>The surrender of the Magyars at the end of the Hungarian War of
Independence in 1849. It was negotiated between General Görgey and the
Russian General Paskievitch, and it is said on good authority, though
there is no documentary evidence to prove it, that Görgey was induced to
consent to the surrender by the promise that no Hungarian officer should
be given up to the Austrians, and that Russia would undertake to secure
independence for the Magyars under a Russian Prince. The promise, if
ever made, was certainly not kept, and the Austrians tried and executed
many of the Magyar leaders.</p>

<h3>Villafranca Treaty.</h3>

<p>A treaty between France, Sardinia and Austria, signed in 1859, after the
defeats of the latter Power at Magenta and Solferino. Austria withdrew
entirely from Lombardy, which was made over to Sardinia, in accordance
with the arrangement secretly arrived at between Napoleon III and Victor
Emmanuel.</p>

<h3>Villeins.</h3>

<p>Under the feudal system in England the serfs or dependents of the feudal
lords were so called. They were bound to the soil and forced to render
various menial services. On the Continent the villeins appear to have
been in a better position than the serfs proper, being bound only to pay
certain tribute, or render certain definite services.</p>

<h3>Villers-Cotterets, Ordonnance de.</h3>

<p>An edict of Francis I of France, issued in 1539, to reform the

<h3>Virginia, Charter of.</h3>

<p>The first Colonial Charter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span> issued by James I in 1606. A certain
territory was thereby set aside to be colonised by two companies of
adventurers, one from London, the other from the west of England. The
first company only was successful. The land was to be held on a tenure
of homage, and a small royalty payable on all precious metals extracted
from the soil. An English council was formed, to exercise a general
superintendence over the affairs of the colony. All colonists and their
descendants were to retain their rights as British subjects.</p>

<h3>Virginia, Declaration of.</h3>

<p>A declaration drafted by George Mason, and voted by the Convention of
Virginia, in May 1776. It declared that all power sprang from and was
vested in the people; that all men were free by nature; that government
should be for the common welfare; that no office should be hereditary,
and that there should be no restraint of the free exercise of religion.</p>

<h3>Virginian Liberties, Ordinance for the Security of.</h3>

<p>An ordinance issued in 1621, giving Virginia a written constitution. It
provided for a Governor and a permanent Council, appointed by the
Virginia Company, and for an elected assembly, with legislative powers,
to meet annually. The acts of this assembly were subject to the
Governor’s veto, and must further be ratified by the Company in London,
while all ordinances issued by the Company equally required the
ratification of the assembly. It was also provided that the procedure of
the colonial courts should be assimilated to the English practice.</p>

were successful, or could escape defeat for a whole day, was acquitted
of the charge. Wager of battle was not legally abolished until 1819.</p>

<h3>Wahabis.</h3>

<p>A sect of fanatical Mohammedans, whose centre is at Nejd, in Arabia,
though they are spread over the whole Moslem world. As a military power
they were at one time to be feared, but their organization was broken up
by Mehemet Ali and Ibrahim Pasha at the beginning of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<h3>Waitangi, Treaty of.</h3>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
